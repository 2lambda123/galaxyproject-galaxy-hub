Galaxy Community Conferences are the flagship event of the Galaxy community.  GCCs gather together researchers, bioinformaticians, service and infrastructure providers, and research data publishers for a week-long event all about data-intensive biology.

If you want to know about Galaxy, and how to enable researchers to explore, run, share, and publish their own analyses, then there is no better place than a Galaxy Community Conference to learn.

# Community and Participation Focused

GCC is a community driven event.  Training topics are nominated and then voted on by the community.  The scientific program community that selects talks and posters (submitted by the community) comes from the community.  Birds-of-a-feather sessions, a vital and thriving part of GCCs, are driven by the community.  *GCC does not have attendees: We have participants.*  Come prepared to engage.

# Conferences

GCC has met annually since 2010 and the program has grown and transformed each year.  [GCC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will feature two days of training, followed by a two day conference, and ending with a CollaborationFest. GCC2018 will also be [held concurrently with BOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/), the first time we have done that.
