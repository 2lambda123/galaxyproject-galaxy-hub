# Galaxy Issue Reporting and Feature Requests

Galaxy uses GitHub [issues](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues) for tracking down bugs and feature requests. Please make sure you search the list for duplicates before creating a new issue.

## Security issues

Serious security problems should not be reported via GitHub - please responsibly disclose these as explained in this [document](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Usage problems reporting

Please report problems with tools and general usage to the [biostar](/src/support/biostar/index.md) support forum.

* If you can reproduce on [Main](/src/main/index.md), you may be asked to send in a tool error report or share a history link. Use [Options/Share or Publish](/src/learn/share/index.md), generate the link, and email it directly back off-list at bug [mailing list](galaxy-bugs@lists.galaxyproject.org). Note the problem dataset #'s. 
* If data is involved, leave all of the related datasets in the analysis thread leading up to the bug in your history undeleted until we have responded to you.

## Bug reporting

1. Where you are using Galaxy ([Main](/src/main/index.md), local, or cloud instance). 
1. Bug reports from [Test](/src/test/index.md) are generally not sent
1. Galaxy version (usually can be obtained at https://galaxy.example/api/version)
