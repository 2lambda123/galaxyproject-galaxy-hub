title: Galaxy Developer Roundtable
---

## When

Every other Thursday at Noon ET (4pm UTC) as long as there are one or more presenters for that week.

## Who

Anyone is welcome to attend. If you would like to present, please [fill out this form](https://bit.ly/gxdevroundtablepresent) by midday Wednesday of that week.

## What

This is an opportunity for presenters (Galaxy users, developers, admins) to engage with the Galaxy developer community interactively. Some example presentation slots might include:

Small sized slots (~5 min) presenting particular Galaxy issues, well developed questions, or focused advocacy.
Medium sized slots (~10min) presenting big pull requests benefiting from a lot of discussion (from recent examples interactive tools, Galaxy markdown, history rewrite, etc..) or presentations of user or admin stories to advocate to a developer audience.
Longer slots (20min+) to practice conference style-presentations about larger bodies of work.

These are just some initial ideas and time allocation doesn’t need to map cleanly to these ideas. One can easily imagine very long discussions or presentations being relevant to this audience. We only ask presenters to have publicly available slides. If you wish to start a discussion on a particular point, please be ready to lead the discussion and have at least one slide available.

These meetings are intended to be lightweight and informal, these sessions will be cancelled if no one volunteers to present. We expect some weeks no one will have anything to present and this is fine. We won’t track down people to present for the sake of consistency - this is an opportunity for presenters not an obligation for developers generally - the Galaxy committers group may however encourage presentations for large, disruptive PRs to facilitate interactive pull request reviews by more committers.
