# The Galaxy Governance Model _(draft)_

[Galaxy](/src/index.md) is a mature, successful research software infrastructure project, with a large and diverse global audience. Changes in project governance structures are needed to help adapt to increasing complexity and to more fully engage the Galaxy Community. This is our first attempt.

Several community groups have been formed to have project governance truly reflect the global community that Galaxy has become:

## Galaxy Executive Board

The *[Galaxy Exec](/src/community/exec/index.md)* is a group of principal investigators from around the world.  Initially, Exec members run large grants that have Galaxy as a core part of their aims. The first iteration of this was formed at the _Galaxy Directions Summit_ in 2019, which gathered together ~20 PIs from around the world

## Galaxy Steering Committee

The Galaxy Exec formed the *[Global Galaxy Steering Committee (GGSC)](/src/community/steering/index.md)* to represent the interests of communities engaged with the project, and to implement efficient consultative project governance structures for that purpose.  This group was formed in early 2021.

## Galaxy Working Groups

*[Galaxy Working Groups](/src/community/wg/index.md)* are community driven small groups that manage different aspects of the Galaxy Ecosystem. Working groups set quarterly milestones for their areas, distribute work, and meet to discuss progress and roadblocks.  Working groups are who do the work in Galaxy. (Also see Committers below.)  Working Groups were launched in late 2020.

## Committers Groups

Cutting across all Working Groups, *[Committers Groups](/src/community/committers/index.md)* are responsible for what goes into the project repositories, and in Galaxy *everything* goes into repositories, including training materials and web sites.  Each repo has it's own committers groups, and is responsible for setting it's own policies and membership. Committers have been around since the start of the project in 2005, but have been community driven since 2015.

# Code of Conduct

**All of these groups, and all aspects of the Galaxy Community, are bound by the [Galaxy Code of Contact](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/57d6a3857d397fedf9fbed724241584fd031033b/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**  Look for an update to that, and much more prominent placement across the Galaxy Ecosystem, before GCC2021 starts in June.

# Proposed Galaxy governance and planning structure

![Galaxy Community Governance Model](/src/community/governance/governance.svg)

**Proposed governance workflow.** [Galaxy Board](/src/community/exec/index.md) = group of PIs including Frederick Coppens, Björn Grüning, Ross Lazarus, Andrew Lonie, Anton Nekrutenko, and Michael Schatz. [Global Steering Committee](/src/community/steering/index.md) = collaborators from active Galaxy communities. [Working groups](/src/community/wg/index.md) = groups of community members responsible for various parts of the Galaxy ecosystem.  Idea = Björn Grüning. 

The overall idea is:

1. The technical board and the community board are asked for high-level input → this is the step where the community, either via the technical WGs or the Steering Committee, can influence the process (2 weeks)
1. The Galaxy board reviews suggestions and creates a final high level roadmap  (1 week). It is then given to the technical board which does the following (3 weeks):
Add technical details
  * Time estimations
  * Cross working group dependencies
  * Other requirements (e.g. hardware)
  * a detailed roadmap is given to the Galaxy board for final decision (1 week)
1. Galaxy board is signing off the roadmap and publishes it on github.
