title: The Galaxy Community
---

The Galaxy Project is driven and supported by its user and developer communities. This page organizes everything loosely related to the Galaxy community into one place.

# Membership

Any organization, group, or individual who [uses](/src/learn/index.md), [deploys](/src/admin/index.md), or [develops](/src/develop/index.md) Galaxy is considered a part of the Galaxy community. Community members are encouraged to integrate their own tools and data into Galaxy to share with the public. Members within the Galaxy community are located all around the world and often form subgroups that can differ in size (small versus large) and degree of privacy (public versus private). Regardless of affiliation, Galaxy's primary mission is to contribute to research in a wide variety of fields across the tree of life.    

In short, the Galaxy community includes anyone who works with Galaxy in any capacity - that includes you!

# Special Interest Groups

## GalaxyAdmins
[Galaxy-Admins](/src/community/galaxy-admins/index.md) is a discussion group for Galaxy community members who are responsible for large Galaxy installations.

## Proteomics
Many members of our community are interested in Galaxy-based [Proteomics](/src/proteomics/index.md) research.

## IUC
The [Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC)](/src/iuc/index.md) maintains high-quality Galaxy tools and develops best practices.

## Galaxy Training Network
The [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/src/teach/gtn/index.md) is a network of people that present Galaxy and Galaxy-based training around the world. Members of the GTN are also responsible for generating, curating, and maintaining a large repository of Galaxy training materials which can be accessed [here](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/). There is also a [mailing list](http://galaxy-training-mailing-list-archive.35427.n7.nabble.com/) for training-related news.

## Conda and Bioconda
[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) is an open source package management system that is heavily used by Galaxy to manage tool dependencies and installations. [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) is a specific channel for Conda that distributes popular bioinformatics software, many of which have been wrapped by the Galaxy community.
