title: The Galaxy Community
---
A vibrant community of contributors is the reason this project exists. The [Galaxy team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md) alone cannot possibly [maintain enough servers](/src/public-galaxy-servers/index.md), [wrap enough tools](/src/toolshed/contributions/index.md), [teach enough workshops](/src/teach/trainers/index.md), implement [all needed features](https://github.com/galaxyproject), or [answer every question](/src/support/index.md) on its own. This is why community is vital to our core mission - enabling reproducible research in life sciences and beyond. Members within the Galaxy community are located all around the world and often form subgroups that differ in size (small versus large) and degree of privacy (public versus private). This page highlights these groups.

# Galaxy Community Conferences

<div class="media">
  <div class="media-body">
   In 2010 National Science Foundation has initiated yearly gathering of Galaxy users and developers by proving the project with a grant supplement. Since then this gathering grew into an annual event known as the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC). GCC alternates between US and Europe and provides a forum for sharing knowledge and building collaborations.

# IUC: Keepers of Galaxy Tools

The [Intergalactic Utilities Commission](/src/iuc/index.md) (IUC) was established in 2012 to enable the pervasive use of the main Galaxy Tool Shed by ensuring the repositories available include contents that are functionally correct and optimized for installation into local Galaxies.  When appropriate, the group provides guidance to Galaxy tool developers so that they can improve the quality of their repositories.

	<small>[Code contributions](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/graphs) to [tools-iuc](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc) repository</small>
</div>

## Activities

* Maintains a set of high quality Galaxy tools in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc). This repo serves as an excellent example and inspiration to all Galaxy tool developers.
* Cultivates and shares the Galaxy tool development best practices [document](http://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/).
* Provides support to tool developers on a public Gitter [channel](https://gitter.im/galaxy-iuc/iuc).

## Members

IUC membership evolves over time and helpful community contributors are asked to join.

# Galaxy Training Network

<div class="media">
  <div class="media-body">
    The [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/src/teach/gtn/index.md) is a network of people that present Galaxy and Galaxy-based training around the world. Members of the GTN are also responsible for generating, curating, and maintaining a large repository of Galaxy training materials which can be accessed [here](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/). There is also a [mailing list](http://galaxy-training-mailing-list-archive.35427.n7.nabble.com/) for training-related news.

# Conda and Bioconda

<div class="media">
  	<div class="media-body">
    	[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) is an open source package management system that is heavily used by Galaxy to manage tool dependencies and installations. [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) is a specific channel for Conda that distributes popular bioinformatics software, many of which have been wrapped by the Galaxy community.
