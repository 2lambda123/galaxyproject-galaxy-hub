*The bimonthly [GalaxyAdmins](/src/community/galaxy-admins/index.md)* meetups are back!  We are a discussion group for Galaxy community members who are responsible for Galaxy installations. We are going to try some changes to the format this year to hopefully make the admin meetups more interactive and engaging for all participants.

**And we need your help**

See those *TBDs* above? This is where you come in. Who do you want to hear from? What's causing you trouble this month? Or, what have you worked on in recent weeks that your fellow GalaxyAdmins might like to know about?

Got some ideas? **[Nominate them](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv257YcdQQO7gp3K4USoBzqkd-UDEblsto5UhU34gFlXTiPQ/viewform)**  And then watch this space.
