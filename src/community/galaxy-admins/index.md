*Galaxy-Admins* was a discussion group for Galaxy community members who are responsible for large Galaxy installations.  

Galaxy-Admins was started with [this email thread in April 2012](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/archives/list/galaxy-dev@lists.galaxyproject.org/thread/ON7MIOYB2H4PSXBNTRBFNCTLG4HU7LFR/#5DXKB3GIUGMOZSAM3SPKJ5AN3KBDOBXU). This proposal got a huge response, and thus this group was born.

This community currently continues on [Galaxy Project Gitter "Admins"](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/admins), while the [Development Round Table](https://galaxyproject.org/community/devroundtable/) working group continues the more development focused discussions.

## Meetups

The group used to [meet up](/src/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/index.md) the third Thursday of every two month (starting February) unless otherwise notified, and irregularly at [Galaxy-related events](/src/events/index.md), such as [GCC2016](https://web.archive.org/web/http://gcc2016.iu.edu/). The final in person gathering under this name was during [GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/FMQW/bof-galaxyadmins).
