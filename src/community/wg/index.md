**Galaxy Working Groups: Distributing project guidance to the community**

Galaxy has grown a lot over the years, going from a project at one university in 2005 to the global community it is today. Several parts of the Galaxy ecosystem have become avowedly and obviously community driven during that time, including tools, code, training, and several other international efforts.  **Galaxy Working Groups push this global model to other areas of Galaxy as well.**

## Initial set of Working Groups

The initial proposal includes these topic areas:

* **[Admin](#admin)**: running services, synchronization
* **[Backend](#backend)**: APIs, core framework, performance
* **[Cancer Informatics](#cancer-informatics)**: federated analysis of widely distributed cancer datasets
* **[Deployment](#deployment)**: Ansible, K8s, cloud
* **[Human Genetics](#human-genetics)**: support the analysis of protected human datasets
* **[Outreach/training](#outreach-training)**: GTN, content, events
* **[Scientific applications](#scientific-applications)**: using Galaxy, publications
* **[Support](#support)**: help, Hub, user & dev docs
* **[Testing and hardening](#testing-and-hardening)**: release and deployment testing
* **[Tools](#tools)**: wrapping, installation, and maintenance
* **[UI/UX](#ui-ux)**: scale, accessibility, consistency
