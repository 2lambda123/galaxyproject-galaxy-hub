# Training at GCC2019

Training on a wide range of topics will be offered before *and during* the GCC2019 meeting.

**Training topics are determined by the community via a [nomination](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fBPjEmw7Td52rhBnC0SvflnQCD7Ue5IMJ9RkM0SjnYg/) and voting process.**

# Training Topic Nominations

Nominated topics can cover a wide range. For example:
- Introduction to Using Galaxy
- Scientific topic oriented trainings
- Community specific trainings
- Development and administration around Galaxy
- Train the trainers

This list only shows some examples. If you think the communities would be interested in a topic, then please nominate it!  And if you are looking for ideas, see the topic nominated in: [2016](bit.ly/gcc2016noms), [2015](bit.ly/gcc2015vote), [2014](bit.ly/1s6NtMN), [2013]( bit.ly/1i2j1gN) and the [Galaxy Events page](galaxyproject.org/events/).

[Training topic nomination](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fBPjEmw7Td52rhBnC0SvflnQCD7Ue5IMJ9RkM0SjnYg/) is open from **December, 1st** to **December, 31**. Topics will be compiled by the GCC2017 Organizing Committee, and voted on by the Galaxy Community from **January, 15th** to **January, 31st**.

Topics will then be selected and scheduled based on topic interest, and the organisers' ability to confirm instructors for each session. Some very popular sessions may be scheduled more than once. The final schedule will be posted before registration opens.

**[Nominate a topic now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fBPjEmw7Td52rhBnC0SvflnQCD7Ue5IMJ9RkM0SjnYg/).**

## Nominated Training Topics

### CLIP-Seq data analysis from pre-processing to motif detection

- Introduction to CLIP-Seq (What is CLIP-Seq? Why is it important? What are the standard protocols?).
- Data Analysis:
  1. Remove Adapters, Barcodes and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) from the reads,
  1. Align trimmed reads with STAR,
  1. De-duplicate the read library,
  1. Inspect the read mapping and de-duplication quality, Perform peak calling,
  1. Analyse the peaks and find potential binding motifs and targets,
  1. Check the quality of the peak calling.
- Final evaluation and summary of the data analysis.

**Prerequisites**

- Slight biological background (you should know what proteins, RNA and DNA is).

### Population Genomics

- Use of Radseq, Genotyping by sequencing and similar data for analysis of populations, effects of selection, phylogeography studies

**Prerequisites**

- Basic Galaxy and genomics data analysis


### Genomic assembly and data analysis in Galaxy with Nanopore ONT long read sequencing

- The session would cover an introduction long read sequencing with technologies like Oxford Nanopore. Followed by presenting tools in Galaxy to
  - quality control of reads,
  - description of best practices to perform genome assembly from long reads or hybrid long-short reads,
  - determine and plot the structure of genome
  - application use-cases such as determining antimicrobial resistance genes from the data

**Prerequisites**

- Basic understanding of Genomics

### Analysis of bacterial genomes

- Assembly and annotation of bacterial genomes: Antibiotics resistance predictions, Virulence genes, Insertion sequences, Phages/prophages and Plasmid profiling

**Prerequisites**

- Introduction to Galaxy

### Alternative splicing

- Qualitative and quantitative analysis of alternative splice variants. Special emphasis on reliability of predictions and quantifications. Comparison of different approaches: e.g. Stringtie, Cufflinks, kallisto-sleuth, MISO, SpliceSeq, ... Some tools might be outside of Galaxy.

**Prerequisites**

- Introduction to Galaxy.

### Scripting Galaxy through BioBlend

-

**Prerequisites**

- Participants should have some experience programming in Python, and maybe a running Docker Galaxy instance on their laptops


### RNA Workbench

- *The RNA Workbench:* best practices for RNA and high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics in Galaxy

**Prerequisites**

- Introduction to Galaxy.

### RNA Folding and Design

- *in silico* (using Galaxy) folding of RNA secondary structure and structure guided design of RNAs

**Prerequisites**

- Introduction to Galaxy.

### Using Galaxy for bridging WGS and Clinical Genetic Diagnostics

As WGS price dropped below 1k USD the usage of WGS became a reality for clinical genetic diagnostics. On the other hand several laboratories of clinical genetic diagnostics have set up their data analysis environments based on the Exome-Seq specifications. Galaxy can be used to provide a smooth transition from Exome Seq data analysis to WGS by performing the first steps of data analysis on remote servers and transfering to the diagnostic lab the vcf file. Moreover these standard analysis pipelines could be accessed directly by the clinical diagnostic staff and could be connected to the local EGA repositories for immediate achieving of the generated datasets. Galaxy container technology would allow the maximal reproducibility and safety of these processes. In our session we will focus on presenting the typical diagnostic environment, , diagnostic requirements, and the ethical and legal aspects to be taken into consideration when dealing with clinical diagnostic genomic data analysis.

**Prerequisites**

- Introduction to Galaxy.
