# GCC2019 Frequently Asked questions

## Will BOSC be joining GCC in 2019?

**No.** In the month after GCCBOSC 2018, both sets of organizers, independently and simultaneously, decided

1. Not to hold a joint GCC and BOSC conference in 2019.
2. To look into holding a joint meeting every few years, starting as soon as 2020.

BOSCers, don't get too nostalgic: you are encouraged to attend GCC2019 (and we hope you do!), and you will see many Galaxy community members at BOSC 2019.

### Why?

2018 was the first time GCC and BOSC held a joint conference.  There is significant overlap between the two communities, and we had been considering a joint event since at least 2015.  Organizers from both communities felt that GCCBOSC 2018 was a success, and that future joint meetings have even more potential for success.

Both the GCC and BOSC organizers feel that we should try doing this again. Not everything went as smoothly as it could have, but we now have a year's experience and a plethora of excellent feedback and suggestions from conference participants.

On the flip side, there are also significant reasons to not permanently join the conferences together:  A permanently joint conference risks diluting both communities. GCC also has a different focus from ISMB (BOSC's usual conference partner), and many BOSCers (while still enthused about the GCC partnership) really hesitate to give that up.  Planning a joint conference is also more work than planning a standalone GCC.

Meeting together every few years preserves both communities, and has the potential to further increase the synergy between them (which was our primary motivating goal in 2018). This also gets BOSC back to ISMB on a regular basis, and helps us avoid some logistical challenges a joint conference would pose in 2019.

A joint meeting in 2020 or 2021 depends on finding a suitable venue (300+ attendees, and more parallel events is just harder) and several other stars aligning, but we aim to bring these communities back together.
