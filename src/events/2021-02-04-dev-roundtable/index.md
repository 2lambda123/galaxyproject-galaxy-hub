**Topic: How to grow the Galaxy Developer community**, including a discussion of a new Galaxy Developer Training Course, and other ways we can make it easier for new developers.

And an **update on [Galaxy Admin training](/src/events/2021-01-admin-training/index.md)**.

Please [join us](https://psu.zoom.us/j/92752763386) at Noon, US Eastern time ([see in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Galaxy+Developer+Roundtable&iso=20210204T12&p1=179&ah=1)) for an open discussion about ...

We are hoping to offer a new *Galaxy Developer Training Course* in 2021.  We hope to gather input on what should be covered, as well as insights on how this should be presented.  In addition, we would like to discuss other ways to make it easier for new code contributors to come on-board.

Please bring your ideas.

The [Galaxy Developer Roundatble](/src/community/devroundtable/index.md) meets every other Thursday as long as there are [one or more presenters signed up for the week](https://bit.ly/gxdevroundtablepresent).  These gatherings are an opportunity for presenters (Galaxy users, developers, admins) to interactively engage with the Galaxy developer community.
