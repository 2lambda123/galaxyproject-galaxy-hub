Galaxy, and especially the [Galaxy Australia community](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/galaxyaustralia/) will have a strong presence at [INCOB 2019](http://incob2019.org/) in Jakarta.  There will be an [Introduction to Galaxy workshop](http://incob2019.org/workshop2/) and a conference talk about the Galaxy Australia platform.  In addition, we will be holding a breakout session on Thursday morning about *[Building a regional Galaxy Community and Platform](http://incob2019.org/breakout-session/)*.

## Building a regional Galaxy Community and Platform

**Breakout Session, Thursday, 9:45-10:15 and 11:00-12:00**

This [breakout](http://incob2019.org/breakout-session/) will present a vision for a regional Galaxy community and platform for *Asia, Australia, and Oceania* that proposes broadening the compute infrastructure underpinning the service to include regional resources. Furthermore the vision will highlight the control afforded to each contributing country in fair-use of contributing resources. 

Galaxy supports *regional communities and resources* including a large [Australian community](https://usegalaxy.org,au/). Galaxy Australia already supports users regionally from: China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Galaxy Australia operates a nationally distributed federation of compute resources, where individual researcher analysis requests are assigned according to a sophisticated rules system optimised for rapid result generation.

This breakout is split into two sessions, both on Thursday morning.  The first session, from 9:45 to 10:15, will feature three short talks to introduce the Galaxy regional community landscape:

* Global Galaxy communities and services, [Dave Clements](/src/people/dave-clements/index.md), Galaxy Project, [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu/)
* Galaxy Australia as a usegalaxy.* public service, [Gareth Price](https://qfab.org/team-member/dr-gareth-price), Galaxy Australia, [QFAB Bioinformatics](https://qfab.org/), Brisbane
* Future Galaxy developments for distributed data access, [Nuwan Goonesekera](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/people/nuwan-goonasekera/), Galaxy Australia, [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/)

The second session, from 11:00 to 12:00 will be a moderated discussion on the benefits of growing a Galaxy service to support a greater number and diversity of researchers regionally. Topics covered will include but are not limited to:

* What could a regional service look like?
* The benefits for contributing institute / organisation
* How does each institute control access to resources
* Can staff time be contributed as well as or instead of computer infrastructure
* What is the sustainability model
* Regional branding on the Galaxy service

The session will conclude with a commitment to grow a community of interested parties and agree on a time frame to resourcing the regional Galaxy service.
