Galaxy, and especially the [Galaxy Australia community](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/galaxyaustralia/) will have a strong presence at [INCOB 2019](http://incob2019.org/) in Jakarta.  There will be an [Introduction to Galaxy workshop](http://incob2019.org/workshop2/) and a conference talk about the Galaxy Australia platform.

**In addition, we are hoping to bring together all interested parties to discuss launching a larger regional Galaxy community and platform, using *Galaxy Australia* as a starting point, and *Galaxy Europe* as a model.**  We aren't sure on the details yet, but watch this space, and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GalaxyAustralia).
