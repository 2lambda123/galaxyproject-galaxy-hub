[NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) is now an integrated data source on [UseGalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org), an this functionality is built in to the 20.05 release of Galaxy.  You can go from Galaxy to SRA and then ship selected data directly back to the Galaxy you came from.

This webinar will demonstrate this integration and how to use SRA data in the Galaxy platform.  The webinar will be on June 24, at Noon, Eastern US time (GMT -4).

**About SRA**

The SRA is NIH's primary archive of high-throughput sequencing data and is part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) that includes at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), and the DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ). Data submitted to any of the three organizations are shared among them. The [SRA is enormous, and growing exponentially](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?).

**About Galaxy**

Galaxy is a data integration and analysis platform for life science research.  It is free to use, open source, and is deployed at research organizations around the world.  Galaxy is supported by a worldwide community of developers, users, trainers, tool developers, and infrastructure providers.
