*Paper cuts* are annoying but easy to fix bugs. We plan to have a one-day contribution fest, dedicated to reducing Paper cuts in Galaxy and its ecosystem. It will be a 24-hours event to span all time zones with our worldwide community. The first one will be on October 21. Please save the date! It's an ideal opportunity for newcomers to get started. And remember it's still [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!
