FATES was derived from the CLM Ecosystem Demography model (CLM(ED)), which was documented in Taking off the training wheels: the properties of a dynamic vegetation model without climate envelopes, CLM4.5(ED) 2015. and this technical note was first published as an appendix to that paper. The FATES documentation will provide some more insight on FATES too.

   [GTN Tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/statistics/tutorials/intro_deep_learning/tutorial.html)
   </p>
   <p class="card-text">
   **Deep learning**, a branch of artificial intelligence, provides a collection of learning methods to model data with complex architectures to perform different non-linear transformations of data. Using these transformations, patterns are recognised in large volumes of data and new data can be categorised using these patterns extracted on existing data. These patterns are learned by computational models devised using different architectures of neural networks. In the recent years, the neural network architectures such as convolutional, long short-term memory networks, deep belief networks have become increasingly popular as machine learning tools in the fields of computer vision, image analysis, bioinformatics, speech recognition, natural language processing and so on achieving state-of-the-art performance, sometimes exceeding human performance.

   [GTN Tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/statistics/tutorials/regression_machinelearning/tutorial.html)
   </p>
   <p class="card-text">
   In this tutorial you will learn how to use Galaxy tools to solve regression problems. First, we will introduce the concept of regression briefly, and then examine linear regression, which models the relationship between a target variable and some explanatory variables (also known as independent variables). Next, we will discuss gradient boosting regression, an more advanced regressor model which can model nonlinear relationships between variables. Then, we will show how to visualize the results in each step. Finally, we will discuss how to train our models by finding the values of their parameters that minimize a cost function. We will work through a real problem to learn how the models and learning algorithms work.

   [GTN Tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/mapping/tutorial.html)
   </p>
   <p class="card-text">
   Sequencing produces a collection of sequences without genomic context. We do not know to which part of the genome the sequences correspond to. Mapping the reads of an experiment to a reference genome is a key step in modern genomic data analysis. With the mapping the reads are assigned to a specific location in the genome and insights like the expression level of genes can be gained.

   <p class="card-text">
     Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteomes. A proteome is a set of proteins produced in an organism, system, or biological context. The proteome is not constant; it differs from cell to cell and changes over time. To some degree, the proteome reflects the underlying transcriptome. However, protein activity is also modulated by many factors in addition to the expression level of the relevant gene.

   <p class="card-text">[GTN Tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/climate/tutorials/fates/tutorial.html)</p>
   <p class="card-text">Terrestrial ecosystem models have been widely used to study the impact of climate changes on vegetation and terrestrial biogeochemical cycles in climate modelling community. They are also more and more applied in ecological studies to help ecologists to better understand the processes. But the technical challenges are still too high for most of the ecologists to use them. This practical aims at familiarizing you (especially ecologists) with running a terrestrial ecosystem model (i.e., CLM-FATES) at site-level in Galaxy and analyzing the model results. It will also teach you on how to create Galaxy workflow for your site-level CLM-FATES simulations to make your research fully reproducible</p>

   <p class="card-text">A primary advantage of Galaxy on Kubernetes is the ease with which common administrative tasks can be performed reliably and without disruption of service. In particular, because of containerization, Kubernetes provides a significant advantage over managing individual virtual machines, where updates to system libraries or components can cause unexpected breakage of dependent components. With containerization, this becomes a simpler problem of swapping out a container and replacing it with an updated version. It also reduces reliance on the underlying operating system, allowing the OS to be upgraded and have the latest security patches applied without having to worry about how it will affect the applications running within.</p>
