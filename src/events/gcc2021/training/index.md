   The CernVM-FS is a distributed filesystem perfectly designed for sharing readonly data across the globe. Galaxy uses it for sharing things that a lot of Galaxy servers need. Namely:
   <ul>
    <li> Reference Data </li>
     <ul>
      <li> Genome sequences for hundreds of useful species.</li>
      <li> Indices for the genome sequences </li>
      <li> Various bioinformatic tool indices for the available genomes</li>
     </ul>
   <li> Tool containers</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Singularity containers of everything stored in Biocontainers (A bioinformatic tool container repository.) You get these for free every time you build a Bioconda recipe/package for a tool.</li>

   <div class="card-header">Running Jobs on Remote Resources with Pulsar </div>
   <p class=card-text> [GTN Tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/pulsar/tutorial.html)</p>
   <p class="card-text"> Pulsar is the Galaxy Project’s remote job running system. It is a python server application that can accept jobs from a Galaxy server, submit them to a local resource and then send the results back to the originating Galaxy server.

   More details on Pulsar can be found at:
   <ul>
    <li> [Pulsar’s Documentation](https://pulsar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)</li>
    <li> [Pulsar’s Github Repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar) </li>
    <li> [Pulsar Ansible Role](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-pulsar)</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
   <p class="card-text">
   Transport of data, tool information and other metadata can be configured as a web application via a RESTful interface or using a message passing system such as RabbitMQ.
   </p>
   <p class="card-text">
   This tutorial will teach you how to use Pulsar to distribute a Galaxy server's workload to multiple compute resources.
