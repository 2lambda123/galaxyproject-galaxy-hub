Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biological research that enables researchers to create, run, tune, and share their own bioinformatic analysis. The workshop will teach attendees the basics of Galaxy including the interface, using tools and creating, extracting and modifying workflows. Attendees will be guided through three working examples in Galaxy: variant calling, differential expression analysis and workflow creation and editing. At the end of the course, attendees will be able to utilize the Galaxy platform to perform their own analysis and generate their own reproducible and sharable workflows.
