The course will focus on using the Galaxy platform (http://galaxyproject.org/) to analyse data from DNAseq and RNAseq experiments and provide the scientist a platform to communicate the output of an analysis back to the research team using iReport in Galaxy. In 2017 we will add a 3rd day on metagenomics analysis.
