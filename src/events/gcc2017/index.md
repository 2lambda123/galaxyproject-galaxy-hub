GCC2017 is the 8th annual gathering of the Galaxy community. The conference will include keynotes and accepted talks, poster sessions, demos, birds-of-a-feather meetups, exhibitors, and plenty of networking opportunities. There will also be three days of pre-conference activities, including hackathons and training. If you work in data-intensive biomedical research, there is no better place than GCC2017 to present your work and to learn from others.
