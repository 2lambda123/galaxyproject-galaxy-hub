A **Galaxy Admin Training workshop** will be offered January 28 through February 1 at Penn State University, where the Galaxy Project got started over ten years ago.

This workshop will cover basic and advanced topics you need to know to set up your own production, high-performance and multi-user Galaxy instance.  Sessions will be *intensive and hands-on*, and taught by experienced instructors from the Galaxy Community. Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers. Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing well, and used by your community.

Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical data integration and analysis. It is deployed at large and small organizations around the world and used in a broad range of biomedical research domains, and across the tree of life.

# Transportation

The easiest way to get to Penn State is the [State College Airport (SCE)](https://www.universityparkairport.com/).  SCE is served by [American, Delta, and United airlines](https://www.universityparkairport.com/arrivals-and-departures/our-airlines/) and has multiple daily direct connections to Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Washington Dulles.  SCE is less than a 15 minute ride from downtown State College.

Major international airports within a 4 hour drive of State College include Baltimore (BWI), Philadelphia (PHL), Pittsuburgh (PIT) - all ~ 3 hours; and Washington National (DCA) and Washington DULLES (IAD) both ~ 3.5 hours.  Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have reasonable public transportation to State College (under 6 hours), but everywhere else you will definitely want to rent a car.

# Lodging

There is no official lodging venue for this event.  However, here are several places to consider:

* [Days Inn](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/days-inn/state-college-pennsylvania/days-inn-penn-state/overview), in the State College city center.  Close to restaurants, pubs and shopping, and a 14 minute walk to the workshop.
* [Hyatt Place](https://statecollege.place.hyatt.com/), also in central State College, and a 16 minute walk.
* [Nittany Lion Inn](https://nittanylioninn.psu.edu/), on the Penn State campus, and is an 18 minute walk to the workshop venue.
* [Atherton Hotel](https://www.athertonhotel.net/), in central State College and an 18 minute walk.

There are other less expensive, but more distant lodging options.  State College has a [public bus system](http://www.catabus.com/ServiceSchedules/CATABUS/index.html) (*every* route goes close to or through campus) and [paid public parking is available on campus](https://transportation.psu.edu/hub-parking-deck) as well.
