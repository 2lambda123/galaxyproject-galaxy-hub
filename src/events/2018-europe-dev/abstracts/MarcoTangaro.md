## Providing Galaxy based bioinformatic environments through cloud technologies

 I would like to present ELIXIR-Italy Galaxy instance provier, developed in the framework of the INDIGO-DataCloud project, allowing to fully customize each virtual instance through a user-friendly web interface with tools and reference data, with built-in solution for file system encryption to secure user data.
