## Travelling with warp-speed, an update on Galaxy workflows

A key feature of Galaxy is the possibility to chain multiple analysis steps together, either ad-hoc via the analysis interface, structured in advance using the Workflow editor or using a combination of both approaches.
In this talk we will give a brief overview of the history of workflows in Galaxy and point out recent developments such as subworkflows, versioned workflows, tool upgrades in workflows and workflow tests as well as ongoing efforts to support the common workflow language.
We will then point out some difficulties that Galaxy users may run into when using workflows, and analysis scenarios that a cumbersome in the current state-of-the art, and our plans to address these issues in future work. (Research objects, workflow provenance, scheduling errors, workflow progressions, workflow parameters, etc.)
