## Galaxy-E, a new vision of workflow oriented Biodiversity research?

In ecology, research data analysis is intensively linked to home made, mainly R, scripts executed on personal computers interleaved with ******** Microsoft Excel manipulations. However, in Biodiversity related fields notably, A real huge challenge consists on capturing research analytical processes in a way to facilitate reproducibility of these anlayses by very heterogenous community of users, from scientists to citizens through decision makers and protected area managers. A long time ago, in a no-Galaxy far, far away.... workflows oriented international initiatives have been done based on Taverna in Europe (http://biovel.eu/) or Kepler in US (http://seek.ecoinformatics.org/) and now in Australia (https://portal.coesra.org.au/strudel-web/). the GalaxyE project propose to restore a different spark of hope to the fight testing the use of Galaxy to deal with biodiversity related data, tools and workflows.
