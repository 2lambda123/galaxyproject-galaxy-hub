**[Galaxy Admin Training](https://github.com/galaxyproject/admin-training) will be offered online and asynchronously January 25-29.**

This [workshop](https://github.com/galaxyproject/admin-training) will cover introductory and advanced topics you need to know to set up your own production, high-performance and multi-user Galaxy instance.  Sessions will be *intensive and hands-on*, and taught by experienced instructors from the Galaxy Community. Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers. Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing well, and used by your community.

Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical data integration and analysis. It is deployed at large and small organizations around the world and used in a broad range of biomedical research domains, and across the tree of life.

# Prerequisites

**Please review the prerequisites carefully before registering.**  If you arrive without meeting the prerequisites then the workshop will be a frustrating experience.

## Comfortable with the Unix/Linux command line

Most of the workshop will happen at the Linux command line.  *If you aren’t comfortable with this before you arrive, then you will be lost the entire time.*  How comfortable do you need to be?  Here’s a sampling of commands and concepts that you should be comfortable with:
  ```
cd, mkdir, rmdir, ls
tar, gzip
cp, mv, rm, chmod, ln 
~, .., ./, /tmp,
cat, tail, less
man
```

Note: *This is not an exhaustive list (or even a proper subset) of the commands that will be used in the workshop.*  They are included here to give you an idea of the depth of knowledge that is required.

## Competent in a Unix/Linux text editor

Linux has several text editors available in it.  You’ll need to be competent in at least one of them before the workshop starts. Organizers will make sure that these editors are available on the Linux images we use in the workshop:

* [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/): Simple and functional. Gets the job done.
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): Powerful and a wee bit scary.
* [VIM](http://www.vim.org/): Powerful, efficient, and more than a wee bit scary.

## Compute Requirements

* **Reliable internet connection**.  Your connection needs to be good enough that you can
  * watch pre-recorded videos over the internet
  * participate in at least chat, and preferably audio discussions with instructors

* Your computer should have
  * at least 4GB of memory (more is better)
  * Software to access the command line of a Linux server.
    * If you are running Linux or Mac OS, then you already have this.
    * If you are running Windows than you’ll need to get something like putty installed before the workshop.
  * A recent version of either the Chrome or Firefox web browser installed.

# Applications

We will likely start accepting applications in November.  As of this writing we are expecting this workshop to be free.
