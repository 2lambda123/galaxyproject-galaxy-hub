<div class="pull-right">
[<img src="/src/events/gccbosc2018/faq/little_vikings-ship.png" alt="Childcare provided by Little Vikings Childcare" width="200" />](http://www.littlevikings.org/)
</div>

Subsidized child care will be available for children ages 6 weeks to 12 years of age will be provided by [Little Vikings child care](http://www.littlevikings.org/) on the [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/) campus in downtown Portland. Little Vikings child careâ€™s goal is to provide a safe, comfortable, joyful experience. Little Vikings will also be providing lunch, snacks and beverages for the children who are in our care.  We ask that parents bring pre-made bottles, and baby food and snacks for your infants and toddlers. **Little Vikings is a Nut Free Facility.**

**Childcare will be available from 7:30am to 6:30pm, Monday-Friday, June 25<sup>th</sup> - June 29<sup>th</sup>.**  You will have time to check in, get your children settled, and then get to Reed in plenty of time for the start of each day's activities.  Since childcare closes at 6:30, it won't be available during any evening sessions such as birds-of-a-feather or the conference dinner.  However, *you are encouraged to bring your kids along to the evening sessions.*  Evening sessions and the conference dinner tend to be informal events and having kids around contributes to that vibe.

Registration for childcare is not yet open.  We plan to have it open before April.

## Infants and nursing mothers

If you have an infant and you want to have them with you during the day, then please bring them along.  The conference will provide a nearby room each day for nursing mothers.  Please let us know when you register so we can plan.
