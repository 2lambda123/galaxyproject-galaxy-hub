**[Nominate a training topic Now](http://bir.ly/gccbosc2018-nom)**

The joint [2018 Galaxy Community and Bioinformatics Open Source Conferences](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) start with training and *the training topics that will be offered **are determined by you***. Please take a few minutes to consider which training topics you would like to see offered at GCCBOSC2018. Any topics of interest to these communities can be nominated. 

[GCCBOSC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States. It will feature two days of training: the second of which is multi-track and will feature content for both the BOSC and Galaxy communities.  

Nominated topics can cover a wide range. For example:

- How to use open source software using just a web browser (e.g., Intro to Using Galaxy) 
- How to use software packages (The Newbie's Guide to BioRuby)
- Advanced applications of software (Genome Assembly with Galaxy, or Proteomics with BioPython)
- Software installation and configuration (Tool Wrapping for Galaxy, or Using CloudLaunch)
- Open source community (Building a Curation Community using Apollo, or Training using the Galaxy Training Network)

These are only examples.  If you think the communities would be interested in a topic, then please  [nominate it](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-tr-nom)!

Nominated topics will be published on this page as they come in.

**Topic Nominations close January 7.** Topics will be compiled into a uniform list by the GCCBOSC2018 organizers, and then voted on by the community starting one week later.
