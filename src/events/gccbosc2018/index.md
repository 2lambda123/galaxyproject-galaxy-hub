The 2018 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2018) and Bioinformatics Open Source Conference 2018 (BOSC2018) are [joining together for a unified event (GCCBOSC 2018)](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com) to be held in Portland, Oregon, United States, June 25-30, 2018.  The event will feature [two days of training](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/overview/type/Training), a two day meeting, and finish with [two days of intense collaboration at the GCC OBF CollaborationFest](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/overview/type/CollaborationFest).  The meeting will feature joint and parallel sessions, and [shared keynotes](/src/events/gccbosc2018/keynotes/index.md), poster and demo sessions, and social events.  Colocating GCC and BOSC brings together the widest possible community of bioinformatics developers and practitioners into a single place.  At this event the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts.

The event is organized by [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/) and will be held at [Reed College](http://www.reed.edu/), a small liberal arts college in Portland. A block of rooms in the Reed dorms will be available, more details to come. [Portland](/src/events/gccbosc2018/venue/index.md) is a vibrant city in the American Northwest, close to the Cascade Mountains, the Oregon Coast, and the Columbia River.
