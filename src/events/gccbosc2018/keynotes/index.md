# Keynote speakers

Both conferences have a tradition of excellent keynote speakers that address the big picture and current trends in bioinformatics. GCC BOSC is delighted to continue this tradition in 2018.

[Dr. Pérez](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-perez) is an assistant professor in Statistics at UC Berkeley and a Faculty Scientist in the Department of Data Science and Technology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. After completing a PhD in particle physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, his postdoctoral research in applied mathematics centered on the development of fast algorithms for the solution of partial differential equations in multiple dimensions.  Today, his research focuses on creating tools for modern computational research and data science across domain disciplines, with an emphasis on high-level languages, interactive and literate computing, and reproducible research.  He created IPython while a graduate student in 2001 and co-founded its successor, [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/). The Jupyter team collaborates openly to create the next generation of tools for human-driven computational exploration, data analysis, scientific insight and education.

## BOSC 2018 Keynote: Tracy Teal

**[Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)**

Tracy Teal is the Executive Director of [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/), and co-founded Data Carpentry. As an Assistant Professor at Michigan State University in bioinformatics, she saw that effective data skills have become foundational for research and that data training needs to scale along with data production. She is involved in the open source software and reproducible research communities, including as an Editor at the *[Journal for Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/)*.
