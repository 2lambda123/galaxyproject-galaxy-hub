# Keynote speakers

Both conferences have a tradition of excellent keynote speakers that address the big picture and current trends in bioinformatics. GCC BOSC is delighted to continue this tradition in 2018.

## BOSC / GCC Joint Keynote: Fernando Pérez

[Dr. Pérez](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-perez) is an assistant professor in Statistics at UC Berkeley and a Faculty Scientist in the Department of Data Science and Technology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. After completing a PhD in particle physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, his postdoctoral research in applied mathematics centered on the development of fast algorithms for the solution of partial differential equations in multiple dimensions.  Today, his research focuses on creating tools for modern computational research and data science across domain disciplines, with an emphasis on high-level languages, interactive and literate computing, and reproducible research.  He created IPython while a graduate student in 2001 and co-founded its successor, [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/). The Jupyter team collaborates openly to create the next generation of tools for human-driven computational exploration, data analysis, scientific insight and education.

## BOSC 2018 Keynote: Tracy K. Teal

[Dr. Teal](http://www.datacarpentry.org/people/) is the Executive Director of The Carpentries and a co-founder of [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/). After completing her PhD in Computation and Neural Systems at California Institute of Technology, her work as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow focused on bioinformatics approaches to metagenomics and microbial community analysis. Then as an Assistant Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at Michigan State University she continued this work and developed training in bioinformatics and high performance computing. Through these training efforts, she saw that effective data skills are now foundational for research and the need for data training to scale along with data production. She co-founded Data Carpentry to develop and scale this training and Data Carpentry has now joined with [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) to form The Carpentries and more broadly meet training and community needs. She is involved in the open source software and reproducible research communities, including as an Editor at the *[Journal for Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/)*.
