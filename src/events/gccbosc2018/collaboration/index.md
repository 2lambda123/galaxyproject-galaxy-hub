# CollaborationFest

GCC BOSC 2018 will finish with *CollaborationFest*, a 2 (or 4) day collaborative work event where our communities gather to contribute to bioinformatics software, documentation, training materials, and challenging analysis problems and use cases.  If you are interested in learning and contributing in an intensely collaborative environment, then CollaborationFest is for you.

Both BOSC/OBF and GCC have had collaborative events in the past. We'll be continuing these traditions, but also trying some new things this year:

* CollaborationFest will be after the conference instead of before it.
* CollaborationFest will happen in two stages
  * Friday & Saturday: There will be lots of collaborative work, but also lots of learning about projects and software.
  * Sunday & Monday: The smaller of the two stages, these two days will focus on collaboration, collaboration, collaboration.

CollaborationFest will have three tracks that will meet both jointly and separately:

* *Galaxy development (Galaxy Dev):* Learn how Galaxy and Galaxy code development works, and contribute to the Galaxy code base
* *Galaxy documentation, analysis, and training (Galaxy DAT):* Focus on expanding Galaxy community resources like training materials and documentation.
* *OBF:* Contribute to *any* open source bioinformatics project.

While these three communities will exist, the groups will be fluid and highly interactive with each other.  There will be a joint gathering of all communities at least once a day.

# Event goals, and who should attend

Anyone interested in contributing to open source bioinformatics projects is encouraged to attend.  Newcomers are especially encouraged to attend.  The goal of many collaborative work events is to produce code, period.

CollaborationFest's goals are much wider:

1. **Grow and foster the contributor community for open source bioinformatics projects.**
1. Extend, enhance, and otherwise improve open source bioinformatics code.
1. Create, extend, and otherwise improve non-code objects, such as documentation and training materials.

# Registration

CollaborationFest is free, for all 4 days.  You still need to register (and select either 2 or 4 days).  You will need to cover some, and possibly all, of you meal expenses.  Organizers will provide coffee / beverages throughout, and we will attempt to get funding for as many lunches as possible as well.

You can register for CollaborationFest at the same time you register for other GCCBOSC events.

CollaborationFest will be at Reed College, the same location as other GCCBOSC 2018 events.  CollaborationFest will take place in the Performing Arts Building, which features multiple meeting rooms, common spaces, and a unique 3 storey atrium that we will make maximal use of for gathering and collaborating.
