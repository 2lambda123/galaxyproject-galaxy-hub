If your roommate is a different gender than you, then their bathroom may be on a different floor than the room.  Your roommate is not required to also be registered for GCCBOSC.

## Other Options

If you prefer to stay elsewhere, Reed College has a [list of recommended hotels](https://www.reed.edu/accommodations.html), many offering a discount for those attending events at Reed. The Reed Campus can be reached via [public transit](#public-transportation), and there is free parking on campus if you wish to drive.

The conference will be offering subsidized childcare in downtown Portland on the Portland State University campus.  If you are using childcare it may be most convenient to stay close to the PSU campus.
