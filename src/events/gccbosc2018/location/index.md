# Recommended pubs and restaurants near Reed:

**[Gigantic Brewing](https://www.giganticbrewing.com/)** *- .8 miles from Reed College*<br />
Owned by Reedies (aka Reed College alumni). At Gigantic we only do two things: make the best IPA in Portland, Oregon and produce seasonal, exciting, flavorful beers, most of which will be brewed only once. Our goal is simultaneously to create new interpretations of classic styles and to ignore those same style guidelines completely and brew whatever our creative natures produce. 

**[Bible Club](http://bibleclubpdx.com/)** *– 1.3 miles from Reed College*<br />
Antiques-filled speakeasy serving inventive & classic cocktails plus small bites in stylish digs.

**[Double Mountain](http://www.doublemountainbrewery.com/taproom/woodstock-taproom/)** - *0.6 miles from Reed College*<br />

**Lutz Tavern** - *0.8 miles from Reed College*<br />
A Reed hangout. Bar founded in 1947 but remodeled with new style, offering fresh-squeezed juices & hefty burgers.
