Structural Variants (SVs), which encompass duplications, deletions, and
chromosomal rearrangements, are an important source of genetic variation in
populations. They can form new gene sequences, alter regulatory patterns, or
form new linkage groups to produce evolutionary change. With recent advances in
next generation sequencing, SV studies have yielded new insights into the role
these mutations play in adaptation. This symposium will exhibit the latest
advances in evolutionary genetics of structural variants in natural
populations.
