title: Configure Your Galaxy Instance as a Custos Client

_This page explains how to configure this feature, for user-specific docs, please refer to [this](/src/authnz/use/oidc/idps/custos/index.md) page._

Custos is an [NSF-funded project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1840003&HistoricalAwards=false), backed by open source software, that will provide science gateways such as Galaxy
with federated authentication, single sign-on across multiple science gateway
user environments, group management, and management of secrets such as access
keys and OAuth2 access tokens. With Galaxy, Custos allows users to login to
Galaxy without having to (explicitly) create a Galaxy user account while being
able to login using of more than 3,000 available Identity Providers (IdPs). Many
of the academic institutions from around the world are supported allowing users
to link their institutional identities with a Galaxy account.

The required steps are described in the following sections.

# Client Registration

Take the following steps in order to register a client with Custos on its OAuth2.0 authorization server:

Visit the [Custos OIDC Client Registration page](https://custos.scigap.org:32036/tenant-management/v1.0.0/oauth2/tenant)
and fill out the form with the appropriate information according to
your Galaxy instance:

1. The _Domain_ should be the main address that users will use to get to your instance of Galaxy.

2. For the _Redirect URIs_ field, you need to enter
   your instanceâ€™s OIDC redirect URI, which is in the following template:

   ```
   <Host URI>/authnz/custos/callback
   ```

   For instance:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/authnz/custos/callback
   ```

   See [this section](/src/authnz/config/oidc/index.md#redirect-uri) for details.

3. After filling out the form, hit submit and wait for approval from the Custos team.
   Upon approval, the notification email will include your OAuth `Client ID`, `Client Secret`;
   note this info! You will need it for the Galaxy configuration.

# Galaxy Configuration

Next, we need to setup Galaxy instance to leverage the OIDC protocol.
This setup is common for all OIDC IdPs, and is
[documented at this page](/src/authnz/config/oidc/index.md#configure-oidc-backends).
For Custos specifically, provide the following values in the
`config/oidc_backends_config.xml`. Note that the **redirect_uri** must have been included in the list of callback URLs during your Custos client registration.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<OIDC>
    <provider name="Custos">
        <url>https://custos.scigap.org:32036/identity-management/v1.0.0/token</url>
        <client_id> ... </client_id>
        <client_secret> ... </client_secret>
        <redirect_uri>http://localhost:8080/authnz/custos/callback</redirect_uri>
        <realm>master</realm>
    </provider>
    </provider>
</OIDC>
```

Having set this configuration, (re)start Galaxy to have the option of login to
Galaxy with Custos. For the user-centric view of the login, take a look at
[end-user](/src/authnz/use/oidc/idps/custos/index.md) page.
