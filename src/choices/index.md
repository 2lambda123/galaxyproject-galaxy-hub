# Galaxy Choices
Galaxy is available in several different ways.

## Main - usegalaxy.org

Galaxy has a free public server at [usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org/) (also known as *Main*) that can be used by anyone.  See [Main](/src/main/index.md) for more on this option.

## Local Galaxy

* You can install your own local instance of Galaxy. See [Get Galaxy](/src/admin/get-galaxy/index.md) for details on how to do this.

* Alternatively, you can run a full-fledged Galaxy installation using a [Docker Image](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable).

## Use a Public Galaxy Platform (server, cloud, deployable)

The **[Galaxy Platform Directory](/src/use/index.md)** lists over 100 publicly accessible ways to use Galaxy. This includes publicly accessible Galaxy servers on the web, academic and commercial[cloud](/src/cloud/index.md) services, and locally (and easily) deployable containers and virtual machines.
