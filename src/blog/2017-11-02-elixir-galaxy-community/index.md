ELIXIR is an intergovernmental organisation that brings together life science resources from across Europe.
These resources include databases, software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.
The goal of ELIXIR is to coordinate these resources so that they form a single infrastructure.

The formerly known Use Cases will be referred to as “Communities” from 2019 on and a call was send out early
this year to apply for new Use Cases/Communities for the [next Scientific Programme (2019-2023)](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/what-we-do/elixir-programme-2019-2023).

The [ELIXIR Galaxy Working Group](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about/groups/galaxy-wg) is glad to announce that Galaxy is now one of the seven ELIXIR Communities
(Marine Metagenomics, Plant Sciences, Rare Diseases, Human, Proteomics and Metabolomics).
This project built with the support of twelve countries aims to
support communities such as the new Proteomics and Metabolomics Use Cases,
develop a strategy with the Nodes to increase availability of data visualisation tools,
integrate the Galaxy resources with ELIXIR AAI and further develop training materials and events.
