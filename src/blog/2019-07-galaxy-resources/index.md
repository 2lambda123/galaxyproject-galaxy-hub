Galaxy is a platform, and a community, and a sprawling ecosytem of related projects, efforts, and resources.  And, it's hard to keep track of all of it.

This blog post does not keep track of it all either, but it does highlight some resources that we think everyone in the Galaxy should know about it.


# Learning

## Galaxy Training Network training materials

This library of training materials has something for everyone.  You can learn how to use Galaxy, how to deploy Galaxy, and even how to create new training materials.  The library features slides and hands on tutorials that often include complete workflows.  If you want to learn about Galaxy then start here

## Interactive Tours

Step by step guides to Galaxy, directly using the Galaxy interface.

## Teaching with Galaxy

Ditto.

### Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS)

You will need compute.

# Using Galaxy

## Collections and Rule Based Loading

You can describe semantic relationships between your datasets using *collections.*  Running an experiment with 4 replicates, covering 3 conditions over 4 developmental stages?  Define your collection once and that have results be logically bundled together in subsequent datasets.  Collections are one of several resources you use to support large experimental designs in Galaxy.

## Tags

*Tags* enable you to follow data through long and complex analyses.  Tags make it easy to tell which datasets in the middle and end of your analyses are derived from which of your input datasets.  But you gotta assign them before you start working.

## Your friend, the *rerun* button

Again, but different.

## Sharing, Publishing and Collaborating

## Define your own frame of reference - Custom genomes


## Galaxy APIs:  Galaxy Power, minus the clicking

Do you want the provenance, accessiblility, sharability, reproducibility and visualization that Galaxy offeres? But, you want to access it programmatically?  The BioBlend applications programming interface (API) provides access to Galaxy for running analyses from inside your python programs.  You can get all the power of Galaxy without any of the clicking.  Galaxy is also accessible using the Blend4PHP API.

# Supporting! / Connecting!

## help.galaxyproject.org

Have a question or an answer to a question?  [help.galaxyproject.org](https://help.galaxyproeject.org/) is an online support forum for the Galaxy Community.  You can ask questions, answer questions, upvote posts, and otherwise tap and expand the knowledge of the community.

## Galaxy Project Gitter

The Galaxy community uses Gitter for online chat.  [Galaxy's Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lounge) is a great place for short questions, and for announcing events/news and for posting kudos to community members.  Anyone can read the channel, but you will need a GitHub, Twitter, or GitLab account to post.

## Galaxy Events

Looking for workshops, presentations, training, and meetings about Galaxy?  The [Galaxy Event Horizon](/src/events/index.md) lists every upcoming Galaxy-related event that the the community is aware of.  Events happen around the world, in person and on-line, and almost every week of the year.  Take a look.

## Galaxy Community Conference (GCC)

The largest event in the Galactic Year is the [Galaxy Community Conference, or GCC](/src/gcc/index.md).   GCCs include training, talks, posters, birds-of-a-feather gatherings, and a CollaborationFest.  GCCs are a week-long event bringing together the full breadth and depth of the Galaxy community to share best practices and challenges, experiences and outlooks.  GCCs alternate between North America in even years, and *not North America* in odd years.

## Regional & Domain Communities

It's all about community.  There are many Galaxy communities and one (or more) of them may be close to you in space or research interests.

# Getting your own Galaxy

## A platform to run on, *right now*

The [Galaxy Platform Directory](/src/use/index.md) lists over 150 platforms where you can use Galaxy, most of them *right now*, and most of them for *free*.  

### UseGalaxy.*

There is more than one UseGalaxy under the sun.

## PanGalactic search

Searching for anything Galaxy related using web search engines is a frustrating process.  You are likely to end up with results about football, cars, chocolate, phones, or, the nemesis of all Galaxy web searches: *astronomy.*

Don't give up!  Use the *PanGalactic Search* instead.  This uses a Google Custom search to search only the ~40 or so (yes 40) web sites thar relevant to the one true Galaxy.


## Publications

Want to know how Galaxy is being used, extended and deployed?  The Galaxy Publicaiton library lists over 8000 publications that do just that.  Publications are tagged with one or more tags indicating how each pub relates to Galaxy, and if you want to focus in on pubs that focus on Galaxy, or use it extesively, then take a look at the [Galactic]() pubs.
