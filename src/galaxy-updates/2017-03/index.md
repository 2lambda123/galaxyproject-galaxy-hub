# Events

As always here are a wealth of events coming up.  Here are some highlights:

## Galaxy Australasia Meeting (GAMe 2017)

<div class='right'><a href='https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/'><img src="/src/images/logos/GAMeLogo200.png" alt="Galaxy Australasia Meeting 2017" width="120" /></a></div>

[GAMe 2017](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/) will bring together biomedical researchers, bioinformaticians, infrastructure providers, and data producers from across Australia and Asia to share expertise across many levels.

This meeting features three distinct events:

* **[Researcher Training Day](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/training-day/)** on 3 February, aimed at biomedical researchers who need to analyse their biological data
* The **[GAMe 2017 Conference](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/conference/)** starts 4 February and features two full days of keynotes, accepted and sponsor talks, poster and sponsor sessions, birds­-of-­a­-feather gatherings, a conference dinner and lots of opportunities for networking.
* Each day has a theme, and participants can register for one or both days.
  * [BIO Day](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/conference/#programme): Saturday will have a biology emphasis
  * [INFO Day](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/conference/#upstream3): Sunday will focus on infrastructure, tools, and development.
* A **[four day workshop on Galaxy server administration](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/training-for-admin-workshop/)** runs 5-9 February.  This is the 2nd time this workshop has been offered.  The first time was last month and it was [very well received](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/training-for-admin-workshop/#instructors).  Don't miss your chance to attend.

### Poster abstracts and late oral presentation Abstracts

[Accepted talks](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/submit-your-talkposter/) will be presented during the 2-day conference, 4-5 February. Talks are 20 minutes long and the meeting is single track.

[Poster abstract submission is open until we run out of poster space](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/submit-your-talkposter/).   Abstracts are limited to 250 words. Poster abstracts are reviewed on a rolling basis and submitters will be notified of the decision within two weeks of the abstract’s submission date.

*[On-time oral presentation abstract submission](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/submit-your-talkposter/) has passed* but you can still submit late abstracts.  Late abstracts are considered as cancellation happens and if the schedule shifts.  Abstracts are limited to 250 words.

### Register Now

**[Register now](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/registration/)** and avoid late registration rates.

# Galaxy Community Hub Update

We are continuing the transformation from our old MoinMoin based wiki to a GitHub based site refered to as the *Community Hub*, or just the *Hub*.

**And we need your help to finish the move.**

The *Hub* uses GitHub Flavored Markdown for markup,  and [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io) for web site rendering and for semi-structured content (such as the [Events](/src/events/index.md) page). The new platform offers the strength of our old wiki (easy contribution) with a markup language many more people know, easy programmatic access, and all the strengths of GitHub.

Once the Hub is in better shape it will become the [galaxyproject.org](https://galaxyproject.org) site.  Until then you can find it at [new.galaxyproject.org](https://new.galaxyproject.org).  Once the move is complete and the [old wiki](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org) will be shut down and those URLs will redirect to the new site.

Content was automatically converted from MoinMoin and Creole markup to Markdown, and many other things were also cleaned up in the process. However, the automatic translation stumbled in some places and the cleanup and general restructuring are far from done.  We also aren't yet taking advantage of Metalsmith to render semi-structured content and page metadata.

[We are using GitHub issues](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-site/issues/) and a Gitter channel to coordinate work.

# Releases



## October 2016 Galaxy Release (v 16.10)

<div class='right'><a href='http://getgalaxy.org'><img src="/src/images/logos/GalaxyNewLogo_GalaxyProject_Trans.png" alt="GalaxyProject" width="200" /></a></div>

The [Galaxy Committers team](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/project/organization.rst) is pleased to announce the **[October 2016 (v16.10) release of Galaxy](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/16.10_announce.html)**.

### Security

An [arbitrary code execution vulnerability](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/16.10_announce.html#security) in two tools and an XSS vulnerability with the upload tool were identified this release cycle and have been fixed concurrently with the release. In addition, the fixes have been backported to older releases.

The Galaxy Committers would like to thank David Wyde for disclosing these vulnerabilities. Details follow:

1. The vulnerable tools are “Filter GFF data by attribute” and “Filter GFF data
   by feature count”, both of which are provided with and enabled by default in
   the Galaxy server. These two tools share code with each other and the more
   general “Filter data on any column using simple expressions” tool. The
   latter was fixed in a previous security disclosure but these GFF variants of
   the tool were missed when updating the Filter tool. These tools use the
   Python eval and exec functions and do not properly sanitize input to these
   functions. The fix for this issue has been applied to Galaxy releases back
   to v14.10 and can be found in Commit c1e3087
2. An uploaded file’s name was not properly sanitized, and so a specially
   crafted filename uploaded to the Galaxy server could be used as an XSS
   attack vector. The fix for this issue has been applied to Galaxy releases
   back to v16.07 and can be found in Pull Request 3278.

### Highlights

[Some highlights](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/16.10_announce.html#highlights):

* **Galaxy UI plugins - Webhooks:** We introduce Galaxy Webhooks - optional plugins for the web UI that allow for better customization of your instance. See the documentation. Includes work from @bgruening, @anatskiy, and Joachim Wolff @joachimwolff.
* **Workflow run form replaced:** The workflow run form has been replaced by one backed by the new tool form and the API. Nicer, faster, standardized.
* **Automatic tool reload after installation:** Galaxy does not need to be restarted after tool installation anymore. This provides a smoother experience for the users. Yay! Thanks to @mvdbeek.

### Release Notes

For full details on all of the enhancements and fixes in this release, please see the [full release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/16.10_announce.html).


### Galaxy Docker Image 16.10

And, thanks to [Björn Grüning](/src/people/bjoern-gruening/index.md), there is also now [a Docker image for Galaxy 16.10](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable/releases/tag/16.10) as well.



<div class='right'><br /><a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo/'><img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/planemo-logo.png" alt="" width="200" /></a></div>

## Planemo 0.36.1

[Planemo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo) is a set of command-line utilities to assist in building tools for the Galaxy project.  This release included native support for building bioconductor tools and recipes, fixes for running Galaxy via docker-galaxy-stable and Import order linting fixes

See [GitHub for details](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst#0350-2016-12-12).

## galaxy-lib 17.1.1

galaxy-lib is a subset of the Galaxy core code base designed to be used as a library. This subset has minimal dependencies and should be Python 3 compatible.  It's available from [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-lib) and [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/galaxy-lib).

The December releases fixed a Planemo interaction, improved mulled logging, and brought in the latest dev changes.


## Earlier Releases

Other packages that have been released in the prior 4 months.

### Pulsar 0.7.3

<div class='right'><a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/'><img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" /></a></div>

A [Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) update was released in October.  Pulsar is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.


### And the rest ...

Other Galaxy packages that haven't had a release in the past four months can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject).
