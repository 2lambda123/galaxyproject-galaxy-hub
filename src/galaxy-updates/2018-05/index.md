# GCCBOSC 2018
[<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/logos/gcc-bosc-2018-logo-boxed-300.png" width="160" alt="GCCBOSC 2018" />](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/)

[GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States. This brings the 2018 Galaxy Community Conference and the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference together into a unified week-long event. If you work in open source life science or data-intensive biomedical research, then there is no better place than GCCBOSC 2018 to present your work and to learn from others.

[GCCBOSC](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) starts with [two days of training](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/overview/type/C.x+Training+-+All) with a wide range of topics nominated and selected by our communities.  Training is followed by a two day meeting, with joint and parallel tracks, featuring oral presentations, posters, demos, lightning talks, birds-of-a-feather and [invited keynotes](/src/events/gccbosc2018/keynotes/index.md).  The week finishes with *[CollaborationFest](/src/events/gccbosc2018/collaboration/index.md) Core* and *Encore*, two or four days of collaborative work on code, documentation, training and challenging data analysis problems.

</div>

The beginning of April saw a flocking of a large number of individuals interested in all things Galaxy to Cape Town! This exciting destination was home for the first ever [Galaxy Africa](http://galaxyafrica.sanbi.ac.za/) event that aimed to inform, educate, and bring together bioinformaticians, biologists, and computer scientists from around the African continent. Organized by [SANBI](http://www.sanbi.ac.za/) and held at the [University of the Western Cape](https://www.uwc.ac.za/), under the close eye of [Peter van Heusden](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Van_Heusden), nearly 50 people participated in a packed schedule where everything from an introduction to Galaxy, training, analysis, experiences, and system management were covered. There were a number of BoF sessions as well to have open discussions and start future conversations. The week ended with a Data Carpentry R workshop event.

Even though the event ended, it planted a seed for a new Galaxy community that spans the African continent: emails were matched with faces, mailing lists were formed, meals shared, and lessons passed on. Thank you Galaxy Africa!

[Tool Shed contributions in April](/src/toolshed/contributions/2018-04/index.md).

# Releases

### BioBlend 0.11.0

[BioBlend](http://bioblend.readthedocs.org/) is a Python library for interacting with CloudMan and Galaxy‘s API.  BioBlend makes it possible to script and automate the process of cloud infrastructure provisioning and scaling via CloudMan, and running of analyses via Galaxy.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend/releases) for what's new in release 0.11.0.

## Starforge 0.3.6

[<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/starforge_logo_big.png" alt="Starforge" width="180" />](https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge/blob/master/README.rst)

[Starforge](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/starforge) is a collection of scripts that supports the building of components for Galaxy.  Specifically, with Starforge you can:

* Build [Galaxy Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) dependencies
* Build [Python Wheels](http://pythonwheels.com/) (e.g. for the [Galaxy Wheels Server](http://wheels.galaxyproject.org/))
* Rebuild Debian or Ubuntu source packages (for modifications)

These things will be built in Docker. Additionally, wheels can be built in QEMU/KVM virtualized systems. Documentation can be found at [starforge.readthedocs.org](http://starforge.readthedocs.org/). 

The release features Python 3-compatible `setup.py` wrapping and a fix for pip 10.

### 18.01 Galaxy Release

<div class="right">
<a href='http://getgalaxy.org'><img src="/src/images/logos/GalaxyNewLogo_GalaxyProject_Trans.png" alt="GalaxyProject" width="200" /></a><br /><br />
</div>

The [18.01 release of Galaxy  is out](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_18.01/releases/18.01_announce.html ). Thanks to the [Galaxy Committers](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/project/organization.rst) and you, our community!

**Highlights:**

*Performance and User Experience Improvements*
We made Galaxy more lively and responsive. Homepage, published workflows, published/saved histories, and data libraries should all load much faster now. Importing data from FTP will also take less of your time. 

*Web Server and Configuration*
The default web server used by Galaxy has changed from Paste to uWSGI and the default configuration file for Galaxy is now config/galaxy.yml instead of config/galaxy.ini. To minimize the impact of this change on existing Galaxy instances, if a Galaxy has a galaxy.ini file configured, it will continue to use Paste by default unless additional steps are taken by the administrator

*Dataset Collection Usability*
This release has significantly improved the usability of Galaxy dataset collections. Dozens of improvements to collections have been made, some of the key highlights include:

* Data library folders can now be sent to histories as a dataset collection.
* Failed dataset collection elements can now be fixed using job re-running 
* Collections now appear with state and progress bars in the history panel and contained datasets are hidden by default
* We added intuitive workflow post job actions for dataset collections
* The web interface now supports collections with arbitrary nesting and size
* More robust nametag discovery and propagation when using collections

*Client Architecture*
The architecture for the client code that powers the Galaxy user interface has been significantly overhauled. The code base has been converted to ES6, Yarn now powers the build and dependency management of the code, Prettier is now used to ensure consistent code formatting, and the VueJS framework has been integrated.

*New BAM datatypes*
Previously Galaxy only supported coordinate sorted BAM files by default (the bam datatype). In addition, this release of Galaxy now supports three new types of BAM:

* qname_sorted.bam, that ensures that the file is queryname sorted (e.g. SO:queryname);
* qname_input_sorted.bam, that can be used to describe the output of aligners which generally keep mate pairs adjacent
* unsorted.bam, that makes no assumptions about the sort order of the file.

*Experimental Job Caching*
Galaxy can now be configured to allow users the option of skipping duplicated jobs if one with identical parameters has been previously executed and simply reuse the previously generated outputs. 


See the [full release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_18.01/releases/18.01_announce.html) for more.

Thanks for using Galaxy!

### Galaxy Docker Image 18.01

The [Galaxy Docker project has a matching release](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable/releases/tag/18.01), for Galaxy 18.01. The release features the 18.01 enhancement and removes `nodejs-legacy` and `npm` from the Dockerfile and installs the latest version from `ansible-extras`.

### blend4j 0.2.0

blend4j is a partial reimplemenation of the Python library [bioblend](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend) for the JVM. bioblend for Python is a library for scripting interactions with Galaxy.

* Update to galaxy-bootstrap 0.7.0.
* Added support for accessing Galaxy Tool Data tables. Thanks to [Dan Fornika](https://github.com/apetkau/blend4j/pull/9).
* blend4j now requires Java 1.8+ to run.

### galaxy-lib 18.5.3 - 18.5.7

galaxy-lib is a subset of the Galaxy core code base designed to be used as a library. This subset has minimal dependencies and should be Python 3 compatible.  It's available from [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-lib) and [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/galaxy-lib).

### Planemo 0.48.0

[<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/planemo-logo.png" alt="Planemo" width="200" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo/)

[Planemo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo) is a set of command-line utilities to assist in building tools for the Galaxy project.  These releases included [numerous fixes and enhancements](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).

See [GitHub for details](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).

### Pulsar 0.8.1-3

[<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/)

[Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) updates were [released in February](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).  Pulsar is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.

## And the rest ...

Other Galaxy packages that haven't had a release in the past four months can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject).
