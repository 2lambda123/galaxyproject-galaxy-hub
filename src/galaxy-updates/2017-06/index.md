Welcome to the June 2017 *[Galactic News](/src/galaxy-updates/index.md)*, a summary of what is going on in the Galaxy community.  If you have anything to add to next month's newsletter, then please send it to outreach@galaxyproject.org.


# GCC2017 is almost here!

<div class="right"><a href="https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/"><img src="/src/images/logos/gcc2017-logo-300.png" alt='2017 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2017)' width="220" /></a></div>

GCC2017 will be in Montpellier, France, 26-30 June and will feature two days of presentations, discussions, poster sessions, lightning talks, computer demos, keynotes, and birds-of-a-feather meetups, **all about data-intensive biology and the tools and infrastructure that support it.** GCC2017 also includes data and coding hacks, and **[two days of training](https://gcc2017.sched.com/overview/type/Training)** covering 16 different topics.
 
GCC2017 will be held at [Le Corum Conference Centre](http://www.montpellier-events.com/en/The-Corum/Presentation) in the heart of [Montpellier](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/location), just 10km from the Mediterranean. This event will gather several hundred researchers addressing diverse questions and facing common challenges in data intensive life science research. GCC participants work across the tree of life, come from around the world, and work at universities, research organizations, industry, medical schools and research hospitals.

## Regular Registration Rates Extended to June 16

If you missed the May 31 regular registration deadline then don't worry because it has been extended to June 16.  **[Regular registration](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/registration) starts at 75€ / day for post-docs and students.  You can also [book low cost conference housing](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/lodging) when you register.


## Submit a Lightning Talk!

<div class="left"><a href="https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/submit"><img src="/src/galaxy-updates/2017-06/lightning.png" alt='Stike out and strut your work with a GCC2017 lightning talk!' width="60" /></a></div>

Lightning talks are an excellent chance to share your work, preliminary or otherwise, with the community.  Lightning talks are 7 minutes long and are the quickest way to make a lasting impression on, and get feedback from all participants.  Submit your lightning talk proposal [by June 23](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/submit). 


### Talk, Poster and Demo Submission is Closed, but ...

[Abstract submission](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/submit) for regualr talks, posters and demos closed in May.  However you can still submit late oral prentations abstracts, posters and demos.  Late oral presentation abstracts are considered as cancellations occur, and posters and demos will be reviewed until the space is full.

<div class="right"><a href="https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/sponsors"><img src="/src/events/2017-gcc/sponsor-cloud.png" alt='2017 Galaxy Community Conference Sponsors' width="220" /></a></div>

## GCC2017 Sponsors

GCC2017 has [11 sponsors](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/sponsors)!  Sponsors are potential partners in your research and sponsorships greatly lower the cost of conference registration.  Have a look at the [GCC2017 sponsor list](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/sponsors) and plan on learning what they have to offer (and thanking them) while you are in Monpellier.

## Hack the Universe: Capture the Flag at GCC2017!

## GCC2017 Call for BoFs!

<div class="left"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRCs97OWt47qmMxWZAtSV3TTLJ24IhW0m2lHGPLiqJU0Xkzw/viewform"><img src="/src/events/2017-gcc/gcc2017-bofs.png" alt='2017 Galaxy Community Conference BoFs' width="170" /></a></div>

There is no better place than a Galaxy Community Conference to meet and learn from others doing data-intensive biology.  [GCC2017](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/) continues this tradition by again including *[Birds of a Feather (BoF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_%28computing%29)* meetups.  Birds of a Feather meetups are informal gatherings where participants group together based on common interests.

BoF meetups are encouraged throughout GCC2017.  **The [current list of BoFs is available on the conference web site](http://bit.ly/gcc2017bofs).** BoFs are posted as soon as they are proposed.  The exact time and schedule for each will be set in mid to late June.

**Want to plan a BoF?**

To launch a Birds of a Feather meetup **[submit your BoF idea here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRCs97OWt47qmMxWZAtSV3TTLJ24IhW0m2lHGPLiqJU0Xkzw/viewform).** Once submitted, the conference organizers will create the [BoF in the conference schedule](http://bit.ly/gcc2016BOFS), and give you edit access.

**BoF Support**

The conference *enables and encourages* BoFs by

* Encouraging conference participants to organize BoFs
* Promote BoFs to all conference participants, over and over, both before and during the conference.
* Coordinate and reserve rooms for BoFs, and allocate time in the schedule for them too.

# Galaxy Tutorial @ ISMB/ECCB 2017

<div class="right"><a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-program/tutorials#p6"><img src="/src/images/logos/ismb-2017.png" alt="Galaxy Tutorial at ISMB/ECCB 2017: Making Galaxy Work for You" width="170" /></div>

Know someone whoe need to learn more deploying Galaxy in their organization? There will be a half day [Making Galaxy Work for You](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-program/tutorials#p6) tutorial at [ISMB/ECCB 2017](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017) in Prague, Czechia. The tutorial will provide a practical, hands-on guide to adapting the Galaxy platform to the specific needs of individuals attending the ISMB.

Participants will learn to

- Create Galaxy compatible tool and workflow definitions that are publicly accessible and that make it easy for any instance administrator to add your work to their server. 
- Deploy Galaxy and scale it up to target production-ready resources such as a Postgres database, NGINX webserver, and distributed resource managers such SLURM or PBS.

Interested? Sign up when you [register](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-registration#tutorials) for ISMB/ECCB (and register before the tutorial fills up).

We also expect a lot of other Galaxy-related content at ISMB/ECCB 2017 and [BOSC 2017](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2017). We'll add the presentations to the [Galaxy @ ISMB/ECCB 2017 & BOSC 2017](/src/events/2017-ismb-bosc/index.md) event page as the schedules are posted.  (And, [please let us know](mailto:outreach@galaxyproject.org) if you have anything on the program.)

See you in Prague!

# Tools

## Qiime and mothur

<div class='center'>
<a href='http://qiime.org/'><img src="/src/images/logos/qiime.png" alt="Qiime: Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology" height="100" /></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.mothur.org/"><img src="/src/images/logos/mothur_300.png" alt="mothur" height="100" /></a><br />
</div>

Galaxy has reached many different communities far beyond classical NGS. To support this the [IUC](/src/iuc/index.md) is organising regularly contribution fests dedicated to special topics, with the aim to increase tool coverage and develop re-usable workflows. One of the first contribution fests focused on metagenomics, a field that is gaining more traction in the Galaxy community. Here we highlight two pull requests that were recently merged and added [Qiime (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology)](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/pull/431) and [mothur](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/pull/1287) to Galaxy. These tools are the most popular pipelines used by the microbial ecology community to perform microbiome analyses from raw DNA sequencing data.

Based on previous work by James Johnson, ~150 tools were developed and adapted to the most recent IUC standards for Galaxy tools, including integration with [BioConda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/). This effort was led by [Saskia Hiltemann](https://github.com/shiltemann) and [Bérénice Batut](http://bebatut.fr/) and several reviewers and contributors, who created more than 300 commits and touched more than 600 files (including test-data). Thanks Saskia and Bérénice for this effort!

The tools can be installed via the Galaxy Tool Shed:

* [Qiime](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/suite_qiime)
* [mothur](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/suite_mothur)

Both tool suites and many more metagenomics tools are integrated into the [metagenomic Galaxy flavor](https://github.com/shiltemann/galaxy-metagenomics).

### CloudLaunch ##

Technically, the [all-new Galaxy CloudLaunch service](https://beta.launch.usegalaxy.org/) has been in public beta since February but keep in mind that it will replace the [current CloudLaunch service](https://launch.usegalaxy.org/launch) eventually so give it a try and let us know how it performs for you.

### CloudBridge 0.2.0

[CloudBridge](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge) aims to provide a simple layer of abstraction over different cloud providers, reducing or eliminating the need to write conditional code for each cloud. It is currently under development and is in an Alpha state.  [Release 0.2.0](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge/releases/tag/v0.2.0) includes several fixes and enhancements.


### Planemo 0.39 - 0.40

<div class='right'><br /><a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo/'><img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/planemo-logo.png" alt="" width="200" /></a></div>

[Planemo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo) is a set of command-line utilities to assist in building tools for the Galaxy project.  These releases included [numerous fixes and enhancements](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).

See [GitHub for details](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).

### Starforge 0.3

<div class='right'>
<a href='https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge/blob/master/README.rst'><img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/starforge_logo_big.png" alt="Starforge" width="180" /></a>
</div>

[Starforge](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/starforge) is a collection of scripts that supports the building of components for Galaxy.  Specifically, with Starforge you can:

* Build [Galaxy Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) dependencies
* Build [Python Wheels](http://pythonwheels.com/) (e.g. for the [Galaxy Wheels Server](http://wheels.galaxyproject.org/))
* Rebuild Debian or Ubuntu source packages (for modifications)

These things will be built in Docker. Additionally, wheels can be built in QEMU/KVM virtualized systems.

Documentation can be found at [starforge.readthedocs.org](http://starforge.readthedocs.org/). 

### Pulsar 0.7.4

<div class='right'><a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/'><img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" /></a></div>

A [Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) update was released in February.  Pulsar is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.

[This release](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar/blob/master/HISTORY.rst) contains Conda and flake8 updates.

### sequence_utils

Galaxy's [sequence utilities](https://github.com/galaxyproject/sequence_utils) are a set of Python modules for reading, analyzing, and converting sequence formats.


### And the rest ...

Other Galaxy packages that haven't had a release in the past four months can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject).
