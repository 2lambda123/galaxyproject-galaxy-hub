We are pleased to announce the [new platform directory](/src/use/index.md) for public Galaxy servers, cloud services, containers, and VMs. This directory lists 125 platforms where you can use or deploy your own Galaxy Server with minimal effort.

These resources cover a wide spectrum of domains all across life sciences.  There are resources for genomics (lots of them), metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery and even some outside biology like natural language processing (a couple of them), and social science.  All of these resources can be used, either right now, or shortly after getting an account.

*Almost all of them are free to use (Commercial clouds are the exception) and almost all of them are open to everyone (Academic clouds are the exception).*

This directory replaces the previously separate public server, cloud service, and virtual appliance directories.  [Everything is now in one spot](/src/use/index.md).

Go ahead, *give it a spin*.
