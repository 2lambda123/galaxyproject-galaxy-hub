**[Nominate a training topic Now](http://bir.ly/gccbosc2018-nom)**

The joint [2018 Galaxy Community and Bioinformatics Open Source Conferences](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) start with training and *the training topics that will be offered are determined by **you***. Please take a few minutes to consider which training topics you would like to see offered at GCCBOSC2018. Any topics of interest to these communities can be nominated. 

[GCCBOSC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States. It will feature two days of training: the second of which is multi-track and will feature content for both the BOSC and Galaxy communities.  

Nominated topics can cover a wide range. For example:

- How to use open source software using just a web browser (e.g., Intro to Using Galaxy) 
- How to use software packages (The Newbie's Guide to BioRuby)
- Advanced applications of software (Genome Assembly with Galaxy, or Proteomics with BioPython)
- Software installation and configuration (Tool Wrapping for Galaxy, or Using CloudLaunch)
- Open source community (Building a Curation Community using Apollo, or Training using the Galaxy Training Network)

This list only shows some examples.  If you are looking for ideas, see topics nominated for [GCC2017](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyCndVqfXx-HsyFJ4hjaK075vDbPM1kE58qO2lJTOG8/edit?usp=sharing), [GCC2016](bit.ly/gcc2016noms), [GCC2015](http://bit.ly/gcc2015vote), [GCC2014](http://bit.ly/1s6NtMN), and the [Galaxy Events page](/src/events/index.md), which lists what training the community is offering outside of GCCs.

Basically, if you think the communities would be interested in a topic, then please [nominate it](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-tr-nom)!
