# GCC2019 Registration 

**[Registration](/src/events/gcc2019/registration/index.md) for the [2019 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) is open! Discounted registration rates are available until 17MAY19.** 

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/src/events/gcc2019/gcc2019-logo-big.png" alt="GCC2019" />](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md)

GCC2019 will be held 1-6 July in Freiburg, Germany.  The *tenth* [GCC](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) will have many familiar features from earlier years, including accepted and lightning talks, posters and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings (BoFs), training, and a CollaborationFest.  GCC2019 brings the [most significant conference program update](https://gcc2019.sched.com/) in several years:

* some training will be integrated with the main conference,
* three days of conference instead of two,
* several parallel sessions,
* and a strong emphasis on organizing content by domain.

GCC2019, like every GCC before it, will be built around **community**.  Training topics are nominated, selected, and presented by the community.  Presentations will  feature the full spectrum of Galaxy applications, enhancements and deployments from the community as well.

If you are working in data intensive life science research then there will not be a better place to share your work, learn from others, and find new collaborators.

Please find additional information on GCC2019 [here](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md).

# Galaxy Platforms News

The [Galaxy Platform Directory](/src/use/index.md) lists resources for easily running your analysis on Galaxy, including publicly available servers, cloud services, and containers and VMs that run Galaxy.  A lot was added in March:


## Single Cell Omics Galaxy workbench 

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/src/use/singlecell/logo_single_cell.svg" alt="scworkbench" />](/src/use/singlecell/index.md)

The [Single Cell Omics workbench](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu/) is a comprehensive set of analysis tools and consolidated workflows for single cell analysis. The current implementation comprises more than 20 bioinformatics tools dedicated to different research areas of single cell biology.

## NetworkAnalyst 

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/src/news/2019-05-galaxy-update/networkanalyst.png" alt="networkanalyst" />](https://www.networkanalyst.ca)

[NetworkAnalyst](https://www.networkanalyst.ca/) is an online analysis environment for transcriptome profiling, network analysis, and meta analysis for gene expression data. NetworkAnalyst has developed and made available a [public Galaxy server](https://galaxy.networkanalyst.ca/) to support raw RNAseq processing for 17 species covering mammals, birds, bacteria, plants and parasites. 

## MiModD NacreousMap

[CellOragnizer](http://www.cellorganizer.org/) creates generative models of the spatial organization of cells from microscope images and automatically provides geometries for spatial simulations of cell processes and behaviors. A [Galaxy] server provides access to CellOrganizer tools for users who do not have the resources to run the Matlab or Docker versions.

## CIRM-CFBP

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/src/use/cirm-cfbp/cirm-cfbp-banner.png" alt="cirmcfbp" />](/src/use/cirm-cfbp/index.md)

## Galaxy for Compound Activity Classification

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/src/use/gcac/gcac-landing.png" alt="gcac" />](/src/use/gcac/index.md)

[Galaxy for Compound Activity Classification (GCAC)](https://github.com/LynnLab-JNU/gcac-galaxy-tools)is a one stop solution for data generation, data preparation, feature selection, model building, prediction and retrival of potential molecules. [GCAC](/src/use/gcac/index.md) is available as a [public Galaxy server](http://ccbb.jnu.ac.in/gcac), a [VM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZQM5x-9J49rvPy9SoWOrM3Xm1MHZdr1I/view?usp=sharing), and an installable [Galaxy tool suite](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=351af44ceb587e54) from the toolshed.

## MGS-FAST

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/src/use/mgs-fast/mgs-fast-fig2.png" alt="mgsfast" />](/src/use/mgs-fast/index.md)

[MGS-Fast](https://github.com/BCIL/MGS-Fast) is an analysis approach to rapidly map a metagenomics shotgun sequencing (MGS) data set and assign known functions to reads originating from microbial genes, producing counts of KEGG gene orthologs as output. This rapid annotation method is freely available as a [Galaxy workflow within a Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bcil/metagenome).

# Doc, Hub, and Training Updates

Updates from the [Galaxy Training Materials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/) in April:

## Hub 

[User Authentication and Authorization](/src/authnz/index.md) in Galaxy by 

The [User Authentication and Authorization](/src/authnz/index.md) docs explain all of Galaxy's features that (a) enable users to login to Galaxy using their social and institutional identities (e.g., using their Google account), and (b) allows them to securely authorize Galaxy to access their private cloud-based resources. Both (a) and (b) are described for [admins (how to configure Galaxy for that feature)]((/src/authnz/cloud/demo/index.md) and [users (how to use that feature)]((/src/authnz/cloud/index.md) separately.
