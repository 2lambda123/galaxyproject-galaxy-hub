**[2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition) will be held 28 June through July 10, and will be [virtual, affordable, and globally accessible](/src/news/2021-02-gcc-virtual/index.md).**

**[Registration](/src/news/2021-04-gcc-reg/index.md) and [abstract submission](/src/news/2021-04-gcc-abstract/index.md) are now open.**

GCC2021 includes a week of training, a 3 day conference, and a multi-day CollaborationFest.  It is an excellent venue for sharing your work and learning how others are addressing challenges in data-intensive science.

But is only an excellent opportunity if you can participate.  Events will either be around-the-clock (Training, CoFest), or offered twice each day, 9 hours apart (Meeting).  Geography will not be a barrier to participating in GCC2021.  

# GCC2021 Fellowships
