NBIC, the host and co-sponsor of the [2011 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2011)](/src/GCC2011/index.md) sponsored the videotaping of all talks at the meeting and has now made those recordings available for viewing online.  See the [GCC2011](/src/GCC2011/index.md) page for links.

We had several requests for this, and I would like to thank NBIC for making this happen.
