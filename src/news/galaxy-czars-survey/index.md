<div class='newsItemHeader'>[Deploying Galaxy? Wanna Talk?](/src/news/galaxy-czars-survey/index.md)</div>

The email post "[Interested in speaking with other institutions deploying Galaxy locally?](http://dev.list.galaxyproject.org/Interested-in-speaking-with-other-institutions-deploying-Galaxy-locally-td4593471.html)" by Ann Black-Ziegelbein generated a huge amount of interest.  Ann proposed a bi-monthly conference call to discuss the broader issues of doing Galaxy deployments.

The resulting community, now dubbed [GalaxyCzars](/src/community/GalaxyCzars/index.md), welcomes anyone who cares about Galaxy deployments and wants to share their experience, or learn from others.  If that describes you, please help us get started by **[taking this short survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGJZcmxEWDQ3aERPNmlBaDl1eHVsQ3c6MQ)**.  This will help steer the teleconferences as we get going (and also alleviate having to spend time on the call providing the same background info).  The results of the survey will be made public on the [GalaxyCzars](/src/community/GalaxyCzars/index.md) and [Capacity Planning](/src/admin/capacity-planning/index.md) pages.
