**Registration and abstract submission are open for the [2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition).**

# About GCC2021

**GCC2021 will be held 28 June through July 10, and will be [virtual, affordable, and globally accessible](/src/news/2021-02-gcc-virtual/index.md).**

GCC2021 will [start on 28 June](https://gcc2021.sched.com/) with a [__week of online training__](/src/events/gcc2021/training/index.md). Training will use the GTN Smörgåsbord model: lectures will be prerecorded, with live help available on chat for the duration of the week.  This model allows participants to learn at their own pace, avoids scheduling conflicts that are inherent with live multi-track training, and enables those with low bandwidth internet connections to fully participate.

Training is followed by a 3 day conference, 6-8 July, that features talks, Q&A, posters, demos, bird-of-a-feather, and networking.  All meeting events will be repeated twice daily, making this event accessible to the world.  All events, except for talks will be live in both time slots.

Finally, GCC2021 wraps up with a multi-day CollaborationFest (CoFest) where the community gathers to improve the Galaxy ecosystem, and to expand the community of Galaxy contributors.

# Abstract Submissions due May 7

GCC2021 is seeking oral presentations, lightning talks, posters, and demos, from researchers, developers, and educators using, supporting and extending Galaxy all over the world. If you would like to present your work, please [submit your abstract](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition#abstracts) by May 7.
