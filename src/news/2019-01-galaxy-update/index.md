# Event News

Tired of sitting in the same old *time zone* ?  Here are some upcoming events to help get you out and about.

<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 460px" src="/src/events/admin-training2016/2016-admin-training-feedback-cloud.png" alt="Feedback from 2016 Admin Training Participants" />

## 2019 Galaxy Admin Training

[<img class="float-left" src="/src/events/2019-admin-training/2019-admin-training-logo.png" alt="Galaxy Admin Training" style="max-width: 150px" />](/src/events/2019-admin-training/index.md)

**There is still space, but [register today](/src/events/2019-admin-training/index.md#registration) as that space is limited and the workshop will likely sell out.**

[Galaxy Admin Training](/src/events/2018-europe-dev/index.md) will be offered January 28 through February 1 at Penn State University, where the Galaxy Project got started over ten years ago. The workshop is split into a [2 day introductory session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#basic-sessions) and a [3 day advanced topics session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#advanced-sessions). Participants can register for one or both sessions. See the [Galaxy 2019 Admin Training page](/src/events/2019-admin-training/index.md) for more details.

Still wondering if you should go? Here's some feedback from the last time this group taught this workshop (2 years ago),

## Galaxy @ PAG 2019

Going to **[Plant and Animal Genome](http://www.intlpag.org/)** in San Diego this month?  Do you have a colleague who will be there? PAG is an ideal venue for learning about Galaxy and how to apply it to complex research analysis problems.

There will be a [Galaxy Workshop](https://plan.core-apps.com/pag_2019/event/9441a7255c56cf0ce04b90bfc40d5302) featuring 6 talks from the community, plus a [page full of other talks and posters](/src/events/2019-pag/index.md) during the rest of the conference.  Some Galaxy highlights from PAG 2019:

## Galaxy needs your Google Summer of Code Project suggestions

[<img class="float-left" src="/src/develop/gsoc/ogi-gsoc-3-suns.png" alt="Galaxy @ PAG 2019" style="max-width: 300px" />](/src/news/2018-12-gsoc/index.md)

Galaxy will be applying to participate in the [2019 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).  We will again be participating as part of the **[Open Genome Informatics Group](http://gmod.org/wiki/GSoC)** that also includes [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/), [GMOD](http://gmod.org/), [Reactome](https://reactome.org), [MGI](http://www.informatics.jax.org/), [OICR](https://oicr.on.ca/research-portfolio/), and [WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/).

We are currently building our group's proposal.  If you have an idea for a project that you would be interested in mentoring someone for, then please add it to the proposal, either [directly on this page](http://gmod.org/wiki/GSOC_Project_Ideas_2019) (requires an account), of via this [online form](http://bit.ly/gsoc-2019-ogi-propose).

The deadline for submitting your project proposals is February 1.

## Nominate Topics for GCC2019 Training!

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/news/2018-12-gcc2019-training-nomination/training_gcc_logo_blue_bg.png" alt="GCC2019" style="max-width: 300px"/>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fBPjEmw7Td52rhBnC0SvflnQCD7Ue5IMJ9RkM0SjnYg/)

The [**2019 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)**](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) will be held in be held in **Freiburg, Germany, 1-6 July**. Like [previous Galaxy Community Conferences](/src/gcc/index.md), GCC2019 will feature invited keynotes, accepted talks, posters, demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings and **training**. The format of GCC2019 will be a bit different than the previous years: it starts with 1 day of training and then 3 days with more specialized training sessions aligned with talks. *You can read more about the new format on the [conference FAQ](/src/events/gcc2019/faq/#what-will-be-the-format-for-gcc-in-2019).*

**The training topics that are offered are determined by *the community* so *[BY YOU!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fBPjEmw7Td52rhBnC0SvflnQCD7Ue5IMJ9RkM0SjnYg/)***

Please give some thought to what topics you would like to see offered, or that you would like to offer, and then [submit them as topic nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fBPjEmw7Td52rhBnC0SvflnQCD7Ue5IMJ9RkM0SjnYg/).

Nominated topics can cover a wide range. For example:

- Introduction to Using Galaxy
- Scientific topic oriented trainings
- Community specific trainings
- Development and administration around Galaxy
- Train the trainers

This list only shows some examples. **Any topic of interest to the Galaxy Community can be nominated and you are encouraged to nominate more than one topic.** If you are looking for ideas, see the topic nominated in: [2016](bit.ly/gcc2016noms), [2015](bit.ly/gcc2015vote), [2014](bit.ly/1s6NtMN), [2013]( bit.ly/1i2j1gN) and the [Galaxy Events page](galaxyproject.org/events/).

Training nomination is open from **January, 1st** to **January, 31**. Topics will be compiled into a uniform list by the GCC2019 Organizing Committee, and topics will be voted on by the Galaxy Community from **January, 15th** to **January, 31st**.

## GalaxyAdmins needs your topic suggestions

[<img class="img-fluid mx-auto float-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/GalaxyAdmins_64.png" alt="GalaxyAdmins" />](/src/community/galaxy-admins/index.md)

After a two year hiatus, the [bimonthly online GalaxyAdmins meetups](/src/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/index.md) will return on [February 28](/src/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/2019-02-28/index.md). [GalaxyAdmins](/src/community/galaxy-admins/index.md) is a discussion group for Galaxy community members who are responsible for Galaxy installations. Our online meetups are around an hour long and feature a presentation followed by an open discussion.  It's a great place to catch up on what your fellow admins are thinking about.

**But, before we start meeting next year, [we need to know what you care about](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv257YcdQQO7gp3K4USoBzqkd-UDEblsto5UhU34gFlXTiPQ/viewform).**  What do you want to learn?  Who do you want to hear from?  What's causing you trouble?  Or, what have you worked that your fellow GalaxyAdmins would benefit from knowing?

Got some ideas? **[Nominate them](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv257YcdQQO7gp3K4USoBzqkd-UDEblsto5UhU34gFlXTiPQ/viewform)**

## Upcoming events

# Galaxy Platforms News

The [Galaxy Platform Directory](/src/use/index.md) lists resources for easily running your analysis on Galaxy, including publicly available servers, cloud services, and containers and VM that run Galaxy.  Here's what's new.

## EGI Marketplace

[<img class="float-left" style="max-width: 400px" src="/src/use/egi/egi.png" alt="EGI Marketplace" />](/src/use/egi/index.md)

[EGI](https://www.egi.eu/) is a [federation of hundreds of data and compute centres worldwide and tens of cloud providers](https://marketplace.egi.eu/content/4-about-us) united by a mission to support research activities.  Galaxy instances are available to users worldwide under the EGI Marketplace's [Applications on Demand BETA](https://marketplace.egi.eu/42-applications-on-demand-beta) program. You need to create an account and then apply for an allocation.

**If you are an academic researcher, want a Galaxy instance running on a research cloud, and you don't live in a country where you already have ready access to Galaxy on a cloud (see the *Academic Cloud* tab in the [Platforms Directory](/src/use/index.md)), then take a look at the EGI Marketplace.**


## ChemFlow

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/use/chemflow/chemflow-logo.png" alt="ChemFlow Logo" />](/src/use/chemflow/index.md)

The [ChemFlow public Galaxy server](https://vm-chemflow-francegrille.eu/) supports chemometrics and infrared spectrometry data analysis.  ChemFlow has a [detailed tutorial](https://chemproject.org/wakka.php?wiki=AideChemflow) (although it's in French), and an [onlinie support form](https://chemproject.org/wakka.php?wiki=NousContacter).  ChemFlow is supported by the [ChemProject](https://chemproject.org/wakka.php?wiki=PagePrincipale), a consortium of French research organizations.

## ChIP-Seq Docker

This isn't new in the world, but it is new in the Galaxy Platform Directory: A [Galaxy Docker instance for ChIP-Seq analysis](src/use/chip-seq-docker/index.md).

## Galaxy Platforms in Publications

We tag papers that use, mention, implement or extend public Galaxy platforms (servers, services, clouds, containers...).  Here are the counts for the past month's publications:
