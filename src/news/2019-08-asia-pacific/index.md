Galaxy, and especially the [Galaxy Australia community](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/galaxyaustralia/) will have a strong presence at [INCOB 2019](http://incob2019.org/) in Jakarta.  There will be an [Introduction to Galaxy workshop](http://incob2019.org/workshop2/) and a conference talk about the Galaxy Australia platform.

**In addition, we will be holding a breakout session on Thursday morning about [Building a regional Galaxy Community and Platform](http://incob2019.org/breakout-session/)**.

This breakout will present a vision for a regional Galaxy community and platform for *Asia, Australia, and Oceania* that proposes broadening the compute infrastructure underpinning the service to include regional resources. Furthermore the vision will highlight the control afforded to each contributing country in fair-use of contributing resources. 

Galaxy supports *regional communities and resources* including a large [Australian community](https://usegalaxy.org,au/). Galaxy Australia already supports users regionally from: China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Galaxy Australia operates a nationally distributed federation of compute resources, where individual researcher analysis requests are assigned according to a sophisticated rules system optimised for rapid result generation.

We are already in contact with regional infrastructure providers and they are interested in establishing a regional infrastructure for Galaxy.  Interested?  Then please join us at INCOB.

Hope to see yo in Jakarta,<br />
