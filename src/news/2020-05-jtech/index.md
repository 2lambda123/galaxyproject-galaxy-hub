A [foundation has been created to continue James Taylor's legacy](/src/jxtx/index.md#JTech-Junior-Training-and-Educational-Connections-Hotspot).  The **Junior Training and Educational Connections Hotspot** will support graduate students, junior faculty, and eventually high school and undergraduates students in computational biology and data science.
