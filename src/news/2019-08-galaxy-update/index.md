# Releases

New additions (and editions) in the Galaxy Ecosystem.

## Galaxy v 19.05

The May 2019 Galaxy release comes with [additional user-facing release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.05/releases/19.05_announce_user.html), and the [full release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.05/releases/19.05_announce.html) as well.  Big improvements in this release include a rewrite of the login and registration system, and improvements in workflow expressivity.

## Pulsar 0.13.0

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/)

[Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.
