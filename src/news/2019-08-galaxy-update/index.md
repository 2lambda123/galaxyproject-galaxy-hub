The slides for most talks and posters are [online](https://gcc2019.sched.com/).  Videos of selected trainings and most talks will be posted (we hope) in August.

*Many, many thanks to all the instructors, presenters, scientific committee members, and BOF, conference and CoFest organizers for making 2019 such an excellent year.*

<sup>*</sup>We believe that all of those numbers are new highs in the annals of GCCs.

<img class="card-img-top" src="/src/images/logos/bcc2020-wide-1000.png" alt="BCC2020" />
<div class="card-header">BCC2020 is Coming!</div>

We are pleased to announce that the 2020 **[Galaxy Community Conference](/src/gcc/index.md)** will be held jointly with the 2020 **[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/)**, at the  **Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020).**

The new name, *BCC2020*, reflects the increased blending of these two communities that is happening at next year's event.  BCC2020 will feature more theme/domain driven presentation, poster and demo sessions, featuring content from *both* communities.  

BCC2020 will be held July 18-25, at [Victoria University](http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/about.htm), on the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) campus, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, immediately after [ISMB 2020 ends in Montreal](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2020).  BCC2020 will be hosted by the [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR)](https://oicr.on.ca/) and the University of Toronto.

BCC2020 will feature a similar mix of training, conference, and CollaborationFest, that [GCCBOSC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) did.

# Doc, Hub, and Training Updates

[<img class="float-right img-responsive" style="max-width: 15em;" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/GTNLogoTrans300.png" alt="Galaxy Training Materials" />](https://training.galaxyproject.org/)

**Updates from the [Galaxy Training Materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/):**

* [Workflows: Using Workflow Parameters](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-ui/tutorials/workflow-parameters/tutorial.html), a new tutorial by [Marius van den Beek](https://github.com/mvdbeek) and [Helena Rasche](https://github.com/erasche).
* [Antibiotic resistance detection](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/tutorial.html), a new tutorial (including a tour) from new contributor [Willem de Koning](https://github.com/willemdek11) and veteran [Saskia Hiltemann](https://github.com/shiltemann)
* Slides for the [Galaxy Mapping tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/mapping/slides.html#1) were thoroughly updated by [Saskia Hiltemann](https://github.com/shiltemann). Lots of new information, an overview of real life mappers, and an interactive game! 
* [Biomarker candidate identification](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/proteomics/tutorials/biomarker_selection/tutorial.html), a new Galaxy tutorial from [Florence Combes](https://github.com/combesf), [David Christiany](https://github.com/davidchristiany), [Valentin Loux](https://github.com/vloux), and [Yves Vandenbrouck](https://github.com/yvandenb) - All of them first time contributors! Florence will be presenting [ProteoRE](http://www.proteore.org/), the server used in this tutorial, in a [talk](https://sched.co/PSqZ) and a [demo](https://sched.co/R1uW) at GCC2019.
* [Exome sequencing data analysis for diagnosing a genetic disease](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/exome-seq/tutorial.html) tutorial completely revamped by [Wolfgang Maier](https://github.com/wm75) (who will be teaching the [Variant Calling I - from sequenced reads to variant lists](https://sched.co/Lug9) and [Variant Calling II - causative variant discovery](https://sched.co/LugR) sessions at GCC2019)

# Releases

New additions (and editions) in the Galaxy Ecosystem.

## Galaxy v 19.05

The May 2019 Galaxy release comes with [additional user-facing release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.05/releases/19.05_announce_user.html), and the [full release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.05/releases/19.05_announce.html) as well.  Big improvements in this release include a rewrite of the login and registration system, and improvements in workflow expressivity.

## Pulsar 0.13.0

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/)

[Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.
