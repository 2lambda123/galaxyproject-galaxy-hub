# JTech, the James Taylor Foundation

The recent passing of [Dr. James Taylor](/src/jxtx/index.md), the Ralph S. O’Connor Professor of Biology and Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, has left an enormous void in the field of computational biology. To help fill this void and continue James’ efforts, the Galaxy community has established a memorial foundation in James’ name.

James believed that scientific progress can best be sustained through mentoring of students and junior faculty. The Junior Training and Educational Connections Hotspot (JTech) foundation will ensure implementation of this vision. To begin, JTech will  (1) support  graduate students to participate in computational biology and data science conferences, and (2) organize and host mentoring sessions between senior and junior faculty members at high-profile meetings. JTech will later expand its reach as a platform for academic mentorship including high school through college age students.

To make this happen we are [accepting contributions here](https://galaxyproject.org/jxtx/). Please, help us continue what James has started.

# BCC2020 Starts July 17

<div class="card-deck">

<div class="card border-info" style="min-width: 13rem;">

<div class="card-header">[BOSC + GCC = BCC2020](https://bcc2020.github.io/)</div>

The [2020 Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020)](https://bcc2020.github.io/) brings together the [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/) and [Galaxy Community Conference](/src/gcc/index.md).  If you are working in data intensive life science research then there is no better event for sharing your work, and learning from other researchers addressing the challenges of modern data driven biology.  [BCC2020 will be held July 17-26](https://bcc2020.sched.com/), and offer 2 days of training, a 3 day meeting, and a 4 day CollaborationFest.
</div>

<div class="card border-info" style="min-width: 9rem; max-width: 20rem;">

<div class="card-header">[Register by July 10 and Save 50%](https://bcc2020.github.io/Registration/)</div>

**BCC2020 early registration [ends July 10](https://bcc2020.github.io/Registration/).**  Registering early saves 50% off of the full rates and starts $3 per training session and $12 for the three day meeting.

So *get on it.*
</div>

<div class="card-header"></div>

If the registration rates for BCC2020 are a barrier to your participation, and you are based in a low, lower-middle, or middle-upper income country ([as defined by the World Bank](https://bit.ly/bcc2020wb)) then you are encouraged to [apply for a BCC2020 Galaxy Fellowship](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTXI2-tdgtDZpj0IqrJAa50rPx3gS5des1MH_lLqSIisoPHA/viewform).  **Applications are due July 5.**

<div class="card-header">BoF Proposals due July 10</div>

Birds of a Feather (BoFs) are informal, self-organized meetups focused on specific topics. They are a great way to meet other like-minded community members and have an in-depth discussion on a topic of interest.

**Any BCC2020 participant is welcome to [propose a BoF by July 10](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMv8CEKNVGsnwM0S6G2fXWU256hfyhttaKn6az754OoUXXPQ/viewform)!**  BoFs will be scheduled right before and after the main meeting day in both hemispheres.

# Galaxy and the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)

<div class="card-deck">

<div class="card border-info" style="min-width: 10rem; max-width: 24rem">
<img class="card-img-top" src="/src/events/2020-06-sra/galaxy-sra-slice.png" alt="Galaxy ⇄ SRA" />
<div class="card-header">The new Galaxy-SRA Connector</div>

UseGalaxy.org and the NIH Sequence Read Archive are now directly connected, enabling researchers to work with SRA data available from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) more easily within the Galaxy framework. This connection was presented in a webinar on June 24.  [Slides and video](/src/events/2020-06-sra/index.md) from the webinar and a GTN tutorial (see below) are now available.  This functionality will be included in the 2020.05 release.
</div>

<div class="card-header">RFI: Use of Cloud Resources and New File Formats for SRA</div>

NIH has released a request for information (RFI) to solicit community feedback on new proposed Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data formats. Learn more and share your thoughts at https://go.usa.gov/xvhdr.

**The response deadline is July 17th, 2020**. We encourage you all to share with your colleagues and networks, and respond if you are an SRA submitter or data user.

# Galaxy Platforms News

The [Galaxy Platform Directory](/src/use/index.md) lists resources for easily running your analysis on Galaxy, including publicly available servers, cloud services, and containers and VMs that run Galaxy. Here's the recent platform news we know about:

<div class="card-deck">

<div class="card border-info"  style="min-width: 16rem;">
<div class="card-header">[Galaxy-SynBioCAD](/src/use/synbiocad/index.md)</div>

<img class="card-img-top" src="/src/use/synbiocad/synbiocad-fig3-slice.png" alt="Galaxy-SynBioCAD" />

The **[Galaxy-SynBioCAD server](https://galaxy-synbiocad.org/)** provides a suite of interoperable and standardized tools for designing pathways from the design specification (choice of the compound, strain) to the DNA parts to be assembled.  SMBL is used for strain and pathway info, and SBOL is used for genetic layouts.  The server comes with a tutorial, FAQ, email support and a QuickStart guide.
</div>


<div class="card border-info"  style="min-width: 14rem;">
<div class="card-header">[ARIAWeb](/src/use/ariaweb/index.md)</div>

<img class="card-img-top" src="/src/use/ariaweb/ariaweb-mol-viewer-slice.png" alt="ARIAWeb" />

**[ARIAWeb](https://ariaweb.pasteur.fr/)** supports automated NOE assignment and NMR structure calculation using ARIA (Ambiguous Restraints for Iterative Assignment).  ARIAweb does not look like Galaxy, but it uses the [Galaxy@Pasteur server](/src/use/galaxy-pasteur/index.md) for data analysis and workflow execution. ARIAWeb has email support and a mailing list.
</div>

<div class="card border-info"  style="min-width: 14rem;">
<div class="card-header">[UseGalaxy.*](/src/usegalaxy/index.md) News</div>

<img class="card-img-top" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/usegalaxy-dot-star-white.png" alt="UseGalaxy.*" />

The [documentation for using Custos in Galaxy](/src/authnz/config/oidc/idps/custos/index.md ) got a major update from Juleen Graham and Enis Afgan. 

[Custos](https://airavata.apache.org/custos/) is an [NSF-funded
project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1840003&HistoricalAwards=false) that provides science gateways such as Galaxy with single sign-on, group management, and secret management. Custos authentication for Galaxy is now live on [test.galaxyproject.org](https://test.galaxyproject.org/).

# Releases

See the GVL Beta 3 release [described in the blog](/src/blog/2020-06-gvl5-beta3/index.md) (and above).

And Galaxy 20.05 is coming....


# Publications

We did not curate recent publications this month.  We just ran out of time.  We probably won't get to them until after BCC either.  However, the next time we curate papers, we will hit 10,000 publications.  *Thanks for using (and citing) Galaxy.*
