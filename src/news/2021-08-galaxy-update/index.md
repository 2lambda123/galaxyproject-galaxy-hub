[PeerJ GCC2021 Best Poster / Demo Presentation Award](https://peerj.com/)

</div>

The [PeerJ Best Poster/Demonstration Award](https://gcc2021.sched.com/sponsor/peerj) was awarded to:

* [Th-6.8: Peptide mass spectrometry imaging of pancreatic cancers â€“ A data analysis workflow in Galaxy](https://sched.co/k5N0)
* Presented by Maren Stillger of the University of Freiburg

Maren's presentation took full advantage of the Remo conference platform, which means that the presentation was not a single PDF, but was rather interactive.  Maren's work will be highlighted in the PeerJ Blog, and this work is eligible for free publication in any PeerJ journal.

</div>

We are very pleased to announce that the [Galaxy India community](https://www.galaxyproject.in/) has started!  Galaxy India had a [soft launch during GCC2021](https://sched.co/kLwE).  **We are planning a full community launch with [two days of pre-conference workshops at InBix 2021](https://easychair.org/cfp/InBix2021).**

The Galaxy India community is about enabling data intensive research and instruction in India using the Galaxy platform. As a group, we sponsor:

* Training and workshops, both standalone and at larger meetings
* Webinars and community calls
* In person gatherings, once these become prudent
* [Communications channels](/src/community/#regional-communities), including chat and a mailing list
* An India-focused server hosted by the European Galaxy Team
* And, later this year, an India-based UseGalaxy server

If you are working in data intensive science in India then please consider getting involved with Galaxy India:

# Event News

There is not a lot going on in August, but what is happening is compelling.  See all [upcoming events here](/src/events/index.md):

<div class="card-deck">

<!-- SARS-CoV-2 Data Analysis and Monitoring with Galaxy -->

[SARS-CoV-2 Data Analysis and Monitoring with Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.eu/event/2021-06-21-sars-cov-2-data-analysis-monitoring-training/)

</div>

**9-12 August**

The goal of this workshop is to build capacity in SARS-CoV-2 data analysis and data management, including data submission to ENA. After the workshop, all participants will be able to upload viral sequencing data, call all variants, create a variety of reports and create consensus alignments.

It will be a 4-day event introducing scalable and reproducible SARS-CoV-2 data analysis with Galaxy. The sessions will be pre-recorded and provided in advance. During the workshop, there will be live support in chat and live Q&A sessions, in which experts will answer questions.
