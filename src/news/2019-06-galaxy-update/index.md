# GCC2019 Registration 

**[Advance registration](/src/events/gcc2019/registration/index.md) for the [2019 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) is still open! Discounted registration rates are available until 07JUN19.**

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/src/events/gcc2019/gcc2019-logo-big.png" alt="GCC2019" />](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md)

GCC2019 will be held 1-6 July in Freiburg, Germany.  The *tenth* [GCC](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) will have many familiar features from earlier years, including accepted and lightning talks, posters and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings (BoFs), training, and a CollaborationFest.  GCC2019 brings the [most significant conference program update](https://gcc2019.sched.com/) in several years:

* some training will be integrated with the main conference,
* three days of conference instead of two,
* several parallel sessions,
* and a strong emphasis on organizing content by domain.

GCC2019, like every GCC before it, will be built around **community**.  Training topics are nominated, selected, and presented by the community.  Presentations will  feature the full spectrum of Galaxy applications, enhancements and deployments from the community as well.

If you are working in data intensive life science research then there will not be a better place to share your work, learn from others, and find new collaborators.

Please find additional information on GCC2019 [here](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md).

## Poster & Demo Abstract Submission is Still Open

Abstracts for [poster presentations and software demonstrations](/src/events/gcc2019/abstracts/index.md) are still being accepted for consideration. 
Discounted registration rates are available until 07JUN19.** Got something to show? [Submit your abstract before the 10JUN19 deadlne!](/src/events/gcc2019/abstracts).


# Upcoming events

These and [other Galaxy related events](/src/events/index.md) are coming up:

# Galaxy Platforms News

The [Galaxy Platform Directory](/src/use/index.md) lists resources for easily running your analysis on Galaxy, including publicly available servers, cloud services, and containers and VMs that run Galaxy.  A lot was added in March:



## The TGM pipeline

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 110px" src="/src/use/tgm/tgm-fig1.png" alt="tgmpipeline" />](/src/use/tgm/index.md)

The *[TGM pipeline](http://r3lab.uni.lu/web/tgm-pipeline/)* is a platform combining [tranSMART server](http://r3lab.uni.lu/web/tgm-pipeline/#transmart-setup), [Galaxy Server](http://tgm-pipeline.uni.lu/galaxy/), and [MINERVA platform](http://r3lab.uni.lu/web/tgm-pipeline/#minerva-setup) to enable visually-aided exploration, analysis, and interpretation of high-throughput translational medicine data. The TGM pipeline enables establishing workflows with Galaxy for data processing using tools and resources of the tranSMART server. 


## ARGA

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 110px" src="/src/use/arga/arga-pipeline.png" alt="arga" />](/src/use/arga/index.md)

The [Antibiotic Resistance Gene Analyzer (ARGA)](http://mem.rcees.ac.cn:8083/) is a pipeline used for identification of antibiotic resistance genes using the Sequence Database for ARGS (SDARGS). The ARGA Galaxy instance provides all of the nucleotide and protein sequences in SDARG and ARGs primer databases in the Shared Data and Data Libraries sections for users. A guide for recommended usage of ARGA can be found [here](http://mem.rcees.ac.cn:8083/static/SDARG_Galaxy_pipeline_user_guide.pdf).  


## NGPhylogeny

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 110px" src="/src/use/ngphylogeny/ngphylogeny-steps.png" alt="ngphylogeny" />](/src/use/ngphylogeny/index.md)

[NGPhylogeny](https://ngphylogeny.fr/) is a free and simple to use web service dedicated to reconstructing and analysing phylogenetic relationships between molecular sequences. The NGPhylogeny service allows users to execute and customize Galaxy workflows while employing a novel interface to Galaxy. Additional documentation can be found [here](https://ngphylogeny.fr/documentation).


## NanoGalaxy

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 110px" src="/src/use/nanogalaxy/nanogalaxy-toolkit.png" alt="nanogalaxy" />](/src/use/nanogalaxy/index.md)

[NanoGalaxy](https://nanopore.usegalaxy.eu/) is a webserver for processing, analysis, and visualization of long-read nucleic acid sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosystems (PacBio) with Galaxy. This specialized Galaxy instane provides access to a collection of best practice workflows and commonly used tools for analysis of long-read sequence data.  
## Galaxy Platforms in Publications

We tag papers that use, mention, implement or extend public Galaxy platforms (servers, services, clouds, containers...).  Here are the platforms that were referenced at least twice in the past month's publications:

# Doc, Hub, and Training Updates

Updates from the [Galaxy Training Materials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/) in April:

## Hub 

The [User Authentication and Authorization](/src/authnz/index.md) docs explain all of Galaxy's features that (a) enable users to login to Galaxy using their social and institutional identities (e.g., using their Google account), and (b) allows them to securely authorize Galaxy to access their private cloud-based resources. Both (a) and (b) are described for [admins (how to configure Galaxy for that feature)](/src/authnz/config/index.md) and [users (how to use that feature)](/src/authnz/use/index.md) separately. Many thanks to [Vahid Jalili](https://github.com/VJalili), [Kjell Petersen](https://github.com/kjellp), and [Enis Afgan](https://github.com/afgane) for their contributions. 

Also see [Vahid Jalili](https://github.com/VJalili)'s slides on [User Authentication and Cloud Authorization in the Galaxy project](https://www.slideshare.net/jalilivahid/user-authentication-and-cloud-authorization-in-the-galaxy-project)

# ToolShed Contributions

<div class='right'>[<img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy-toolshed-300.png" alt="Galaxy ToolShed" width="150"  />](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/)</div>

We didn't get to this this month.  Look forward to a double dose of tools next month.

# Releases

New additions to the Galaxy Ecosystem.

## Galaxy-parsec 1.12.1

[Parsec](https://pypi.org/project/galaxy-parsec/) is a set of automatically generated wrappers for BioBlend functions. I found myself writing a large number of small / one-off scripts that invoked simple bioblend functions. These scripts were impossible to compose and use in a linux-friendly manner. I copied and pasted code between all of these utility scripts.

Parsec is the answer to all of these problems. It extracts all of the individual functions I was writing as separate CLI commands that can be piped together, run in parallel, etc.

## Pulsar 0.9.1

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/)

[Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.


## galaxy-lib 19.5.2

galaxy-lib is a subset of the Galaxy core code base designed to be used as a library. This subset has minimal dependencies and should be Python 3 compatible.  It's available from [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-lib) and [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/galaxy-lib).
