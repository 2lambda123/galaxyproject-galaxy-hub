# Events

Tired of sitting in the same old office/lab/cafe table?  Here are some upcoming events to help get you out and about.

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/events/2018-europe-dev/2018-europe-logo-clipped.png" alt="European Galaxy Days" />](/src/events/2018-europe-dev/index.md)

## European Galaxy Days, 19-20 November, Freiburg, Germany

**[European Galaxy Days](/src/events/2018-europe-dev/index.md)** will be held  19 and 20 November 2018 in Freiburg, Germany. The [first day](/src/events/2018-europe-dev/index.md#monday-november-19th) will give an overview of the current state of the Galaxy framework with several talks and demonstrations. The [second day](/src/events/2018-europe-dev/index.md#tuesday-november-20th) will focus on developing and extending the Galaxy ecosystem.

**The event is free and [registration is open](https://tinyurl.com/EGD2018).**  See the [event home page](/src/events/2018-europe-dev/index.md) for more.


## 2019 Galaxy Admin Training

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/events/2019-admin-training/2019-admin-training-logo.png" alt="Galaxy Admin Training" width="200px" />](/src/events/2019-admin-training/index.md)

**[Galaxy Admin Training](/src/events/2018-europe-dev/index.md)** will be offered January 28 through February 1 at Penn State University, where the Galaxy Project got started over ten years ago. The workshop is split into a [2 day introductory session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#basic-sessions) and a [3 day advanced topics session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#advanced-sessions). Participants can register for one or both sessions.

**[Registration](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/blob/master/src/events/2019-admin-training/index.md#registration) is open, but space is limited!**

See the [Galaxy 2019 Admin Training page](/src/events/2019-admin-training/index.md) for more details.

# The new Galaxy Platforms Directory

[<img src="/src/use/use-resource-banner.png" class="float-right" alt="125+ platforms to use Galaxy on" width="220" />](/src/use/index.md>)

We are pleased to announce the new [Galaxy Platform Directory](/src/use/index.md), for

- public Galaxy servers,
- academic and commercial cloud services,
- containers, and
- VMs

This directory lists 125 platforms where you can use or deploy your own Galaxy Server with minimal effort.

- Almost all of them are free to use (Commercial clouds are the exception)
- Almost all of them are open to everyone (Academic clouds are the exception).
- All of the resources can be used, either immediately, or shortly after getting an account.

These resources cover a wide spectrum of domains all across life sciences. There are resources for genomics (lots of them), metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery and even some outside biology like natural language processing (a couple of them), and social science.

This directory replaces the previously separate public server, cloud service, and virtual appliance directories. [Everything is now in one spot]((/src/use/index.md).

## New Galaxy Platforms

And there are several new platforms for running Galaxy this month too:

### SMAGEXP

[<img src="/src/use/smagexp/smagexp-flowchart.png" class="float-right" alt="SMAGEXP" width="400" />](/src/use/smagexp/index.md)

[SMAGEXP (Statistical Meta-Analysis for Gene EXPression)](/src/use/smagexp/index.md) provides a unified way to carry out meta-analysis of gene expression data, while taking care of their specificities. A Galaxy instance is provided in a Docker container.  SMAGEXP comes with an [Installation and user guide, including two step-by-step examples](https://github.com/sblanck/smagexp#table-of-contents-).  It is supported by Univ. Lille Droit et Santé, Lille, France and Inria Lille-Nord Europe, MODAL, Lille, France.

### SNIC Science Cloud (SSC)

[<img src="/src/use/snic-science-cloud/snic-science-cloud.png" class="float-left" alt="SNIC Science Cloud (SSC)" width="200" />](/src/use/snic-science-cloud/index.md)

[Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC)](http://snic.se/) [Science Cloud (SSC)](https://cloud.snic.se/) is a community cloud and use of the resources is free of charge to Swedish PIs and their collaborators. As for other SNIC allocations you need an affiliation with a Swedish higher education institution to be eligible to apply for a project.  It's a national-scale cloud infrastructure for Swedish Academia.

SNIC offers [support and training](https://www.snic.se/support/).  SNIC Science Cloud is currently a pilot project and not a production resource.  You can  [request a project here](https://cloud.snic.se/index.php/request-a-project-on-the-snic-community-cloud/).
