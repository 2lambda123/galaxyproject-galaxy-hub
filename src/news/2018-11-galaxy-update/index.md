# Public Galaxy Server News

## The Galaxy Platform Directory 
We are pleased to announce the new [Galaxy Platform Directory](https://galaxyproject.org/use/) for:
   * public Galaxy servers,
   * academic and commercial cloud services,
   * containers, and
   * VMs

These resources cover a wide spectrum of domains all across life sciences. There are resources for genomics (lots of them), metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery and even some outside biology like natural language processing (a couple of them), and social science.

This directory replaces the previously separate public server, cloud service, and virtual appliance directories. [Everything is now in one spot](https://galaxyproject.org/use/).

Here's what's new:

We tag papers that use, mention, implement or extend public Galaxy servers, services and other resources.  Here are the counts for the past month's publications:
