Hello all,

The 2021 Galaxy Community Conference has started and we are now halfway through Training Week.  It is too late to register for the 3 day conference next week.  It is also officially too late to sign up for the CoFest on 9-10 July, but if you follow this link, you just mind find yourself invited anyway.

In addition to GCC news, we also released the **[James Taylor birthday video](#community-news)**, and have several **[new open positions](#community-news)**, lots of **[event news](#event-news)**, **[Galaxy platform news](#galaxy-platforms-news)**, **[Galactic blog posts](#galactic-blog-activity)**, **[training and doc updates](#doc-hub-and-training-updates)**,
recent **[open-access Galaxy-related publications](#publications)**, and **[new releases](#releases).**

To us, it feels like everything is GCC right now, but even during this crazy time of year there is a lot more going on (see above, and below). 

We hope we to see you at GCC events this week and next.

Dave Clements and Beatriz Serrano-Solano, Editors

Galaxy is now available in all flavors of the Terra platform.

"Today, we released an update that makes Galaxy available through the other “faces” of Terra, i.e. the project-agnostic [Terra Community Workbench](https://app.terra.bio/) and the [NHLBI BioData Catalyst](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/)..."  Galaxy has been available on the [AnVIL Terra Portal](https://anvil.terra.bio/) since last year.
