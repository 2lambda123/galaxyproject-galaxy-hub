# We just lost James Taylor (1979-2020). His legacy &mdash; open, reproducible science &mdash; will continue.

James Taylor, a leader of the Galaxy Project, and one of its original members, passed away on April 2, 2020.

The community response (see below) has been tremendous, which reflects the breadth and depth of his impact.  If you have something you would like to add then please [share your thoughts here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4iKUV7r91OxRFq6DbkVpSb4ftTP4eQqhvcSl-TD-PUdvFPw/viewform), and we will add them below.

The cause of James' death is not yet known, and given how overwhelmed the medical profession is in Baltimore, we may never know.  Given how quickly this overtook him it is very unlikely to have been COVID-19.  We will add any new information here as learn it.

Thank you for your support during this awful time,<br />
The Galaxy Project

## A man who wanted to live forever: James Taylor

From Enis Afgan,

I met James on Friday, Feb 13, 2009. Perhaps that was a sign for what’s to come. It was a job interview for my postdoc. Preparing for the interview, I had searched for a picture of James to know who to look for but I had no success. He was quite concerned about privacy and the social web of the time had not undermined his efforts. When I finally walked into his office, I saw James for the first time: a person about my age wearing jeans, a button-up shirt with top two buttons undone, and a sport coat with elbow patches. It had a somewhat raggedy appearance but elegant at the same time. I guess you’d call it edgy today. Having had a very traditional educational upbringing where faculty was referred to as Dr. This or Professor That and generally wearing professional attire, I was a bit surprised with his appearance (as you may be able to tell given I remember it a decade later). We proceeded to chat about my work and some of the Galaxy efforts he was spearheading that continue to be worked on to this day. The point of this is that James left a long-term impression on me, and it didn’t take long. He had the special ability to be concise and impactful.

Continuing in the vein of a non-traditional mentor (at least by my past experiences), we would have most of our lab meetings over dinners at pubs or at the SweetWater brewery. One particular dinner stands out. We were discussing the impact of cancer research on actual patient care. One thing led to another and the conversation evolved into a discussion about death. James, always pushing the norms, proceeded to elaborate about a not completely unrealistic path of capturing one’s consciousness in a digital format and saving it forever. With time, he argued, it would be possible to reconstruct the consciousness back into physical form and ultimately live forever. Books have been written about such topics but the point remains that James was happy alive and inspired to live forever. 

Instead, here we are. Roughly a decade later, I’m writing a eulogy to the man I admired and who has inspired me and hundreds of others to work hard and think on our own. James made a great scientific impact on the world. I am sure others will write about his scientific and technological accomplishments so instead I wanted to focus on the generous and likable human being that he was. He ran his lab not as a boss but as a friend and a colleague that inspired each individual to do their best work. He was an enabler. He was someone you tried your best not to disappoint. In addition, he taught me what is good beer so how can you not love a man like that. I’m going to miss working with you James.

Memorials to James from the web

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lead">[In Memoriam, Professor James Taylor](https://bio.jhu.edu/2020/04/03/in-memoriam-professor-james-taylor/), Johns Hopkins Department of Biology</div>
Professor Taylor was a trailblazer in computational biology and genomics research. He had an enormous impact as a scientist, teacher, and colleague, and his loss is devastating to many – both here in our Hopkins community and around the globe.<br />...<br />
Vince Hilser, chair of the biology department, describes Professor Taylor as a bedrock of the department. “He came in 2014, and it was transformational. He was this catalyst for change, with a huge positive impact.” His presence in the department opened up many areas for research, as he was able to help other faculty members uncover new insights by revealing similarities between the proteins they were studying and those in other organisms.

<div class="lead">[Professor James Taylor](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/129652/),  [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/)</div>
We in the Bioconductor community knew James as a Galaxy project leader, a strong advocate for open and reproducible science, and an enthusiastic and inspirational colleague. James recognized Bioconductor as a kindred spirit, and bridged the relationship between Galaxy and Bioconductor through his leadership of the NHGRI AnVIL project. James' leadership has deep consequences for the way Bioconductor now navigates toward large-scale cloud-based computing.<br />...<br />
James' work and personality touched many of us, and we share a deep sense of loss from his passing. On behalf of the Bioconductor community, we offer our deepest condolences to James’ family, friends, trainees, and colleagues.

This is just such devastating news. I have known James for the best part of seven years, as we set up Galaxy in Australia and James, of course, immediately agreed to visit in 2013 to help make that happen. He was visionary, looking to create free, open platforms for global science. <br /><br />
He was also enormously good company, going out for beers and in depth discussions on any and all topics. I thoroughly enjoyed James' company in social and academic forums...but far more importantly than that, he both led and built software and data science communities that will define community-focussed global bioscience from here on. <br /><br />
Personally, it's crushing - I am so sorry for his family and friends, of which of course I count myself - but the loss to the world of science eclipses that. We are all the poorer for losing James. If it is any consolation, he accomplished so much - the world of science is changed because of James.

My friend James Taylor is dead. I'm heartbroken and thinking of all of his family and friends. He is leaving a hole that cannot be filled.<br /><br />
I met James when I started grad school at Penn State. I had no idea what to expect (I'd only learned of PhD programs within the previous year). We were both students, but he was clearly in a league of his own.<br /><br />
James was one of the smartest people I've ever known, in a way that wasn't (as) intimidating. Talking with James was easy and enlightening. He advocated and put in the work for better science, in all aspects.<br /><br />
James supported my science and my career in ways I don't think I can ever fully communicate. As a colleague, he believed in me. As a friend, he expected me to do good. He supported my growth, selflessly.<br /><br />
Most of all, James was an advocate. <br /><br />
He advocated for his students, for trainees, for open science, for open data, for making this world a better place. <br /><br />

I will miss him so terribly.

James was so approachable. Though we never got the chance to collaborate directly, when I first met *the* James Taylor I remember feeling that approachability in that someone so famous in our field would always take the time out to talk to me about science or about whatever the topic of the moment was. We had many conversations - some just a glance across a busy crowd at a conference where that would be our only acknowledgement, some,  hours long chats. The first memory that came to mind thinking back now was the many weeks he spent at CSHL instructing at courses in the fall. There were months when he was on campus more than I was. The particular memory that flashed when I heard this news was finishing a beer with him around 2 am in the cold outside the bar at Blackford. The bar had long closed, but we were having a crazy conversation along with one other course instructor about awful American TV shows. The conversation was of course punctuated with thoughts on comparative genomics. James was brilliant, but it wasn’t this that made him a star, helped him build a global community, or an enduring vision. He was a lovable and decent human being who will be fondly remembered. His work and the community he helped to create will live on. For every researcher who continues his legacy and works to live up to his achievements, don’t forget to bring along also his charm, curiosity, compassion, and love.

I was fortunate to be introduced to James via the IU/TACC Jetstream project, where he promised to consume large quantities of CPU time on behalf of the Galaxy project. His vision and his plans for achieving it were both straightforward and clear. In short: Give us a key to your system (an API key, in this case), and we will make sure it's used for good. And he delivered, spectacularly! While this straightforward approach might at first appear naive, he articulated his plans clearly and proved soundly that he could do it. He was always ready to share examples of discoveries that had been enabled by Galaxy. In later visits on other topics, I was impressed by his astute understanding of how the research community works and how to make (important, substantive) things happen. People like him are rare and special, and a joy to encounter and work with. This is a heavy loss for the research community.

The thing I'll most remember about him is the glint of pride he got in his eye whenever he saw the wonderful Galaxy community get together. He and Anton created something amazing.<br /><br />
