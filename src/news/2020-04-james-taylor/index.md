## A man who wanted to live forever: James Taylor

From Enis Afgan,

I met James on Friday, Feb 13, 2009. Perhaps that was a sign for what’s to come. It was a job interview for my postdoc. Preparing for the interview, I had searched for a picture of James to know who to look for but I had no success. He was quite concerned about privacy and the social web of the time had not undermined his efforts. When I finally walked into his office, I saw James for the first time: a person about my age wearing jeans, a button-up shirt with top two buttons undone, and a sport coat with elbow patches. It had a somewhat raggedy appearance but elegant at the same time. I guess you’d call it edgy today. Having had a very traditional educational upbringing where faculty was referred to as Dr. This or Professor That and generally wearing professional attire, I was a bit surprised with his appearance (as you may be able to tell given I remember it a decade later). We proceeded to chat about my work and some of the Galaxy efforts he was spearheading that continue to be worked on to this day. The point of this is that James left a long-term impression on me, and it didn’t take long. He had the special ability to be concise and impactful.

Continuing in the vein of a non-traditional mentor (at least by my past experiences), we would have most of our lab meetings over dinners at pubs or at the SweetWater brewery. One particular dinner stands out. We were discussing the impact of cancer research on actual patient care. One thing led to another and the conversation evolved into a discussion about death. James, always pushing the norms, proceeded to elaborate about a not completely unrealistic path of capturing one’s consciousness in a digital format and saving it forever. With time, he argued, it would be possible to reconstruct the consciousness back into physical form and ultimately live forever. Books have been written about such topics but the point remains that James was happy alive and inspired to live forever. 

Instead, here we are. Roughly a decade later, I’m writing a eulogy to the man I admired and who has inspired me and hundreds of others to work hard and think on our own. James made a great scientific impact on the world. I am sure others will write about his scientific and technological accomplishments so instead I wanted to focus on the generous and likable human being that he was. He ran his lab not as a boss but as a friend and a colleague that inspired each individual to do their best work. He was an enabler. He was someone you tried your best not to disappoint. In addition, he taught me what is good beer so how can you not love a man like that. I’m going to miss working with you James.

Deeply saddened at the loss of James Taylor. I remember first reaching out to James at the start of my PhD. I had the great pleasure of rotating in his lab, which not only helped me develop my bioinformatic skills, but also ultimately set me on my career trajectory.

I owe a lot to James. In addition to happily agreeing to be on my thesis committee he was an immense source of knowledge and an overall great colleague. I’m grateful for having had the opportunity to work with him. James - you will be missed dearly.

He came to UIUC back on the job hunt, gave an awesome presentation. Sadly I didn't know him well but met him many times through GCC and BOSC (I hazily recall late night laughs w/ beers involved). He was nice, amazing, awesome. I am so sorry for your loss Galaxy community. This hurts

My friend James Taylor is dead. I'm heartbroken and thinking of all of his family and friends. He is leaving a hole that cannot be filled.

I met James when I started grad school at Penn State. I had no idea what to expect (I'd only learned of PhD programs within the previous year). We were both students, but he was clearly in a league of his own.

James was one of the smartest people I've ever known, in a way that wasn't (as) intimidating. Talking with James was easy and enlightening. He advocated and put in the work for better science, in all aspects.

James supported my science and my career in ways I don't think I can ever fully communicate. As a colleague, he believed in me. As a friend, he expected me to do good. He supported my growth, selflessly.

Most of all, James was an advocate. 

He advocated for his students, for trainees, for open science, for open data, for making this world a better place. 

I will miss him so terribly.

The first time I saw James was at ISMB 2007 in Vienna when he gave a Demonstration on Galaxy's tool integration framework - the room was packed and everyone was deadly silent whilst he live xml'ed.

We are all poorer for this today.<br />
valé James.
