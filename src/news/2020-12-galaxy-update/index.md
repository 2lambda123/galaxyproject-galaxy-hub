# Event News

Despite COVID-19, there is still a lot going on. Some of it is virtual, but live events are starting to happen again, especially in Europe. We have updated our [list of events](/src/events/index.md) to reflect what we know.  Some highlights:

<div class="card-deck">

<!-- Aus: Intro -->
<div class="card border-info" style="min-width: 14rem; max-width: 20rem">

<div class="card-header">[Online data analysis for biologists](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/online-data-analysis-for-biologists-december-2020-tickets-123610812267)</div>

**8 December, Online**

This interactive beginners workshop will provide an introduction to the Galaxy interface, histories and available tools. The material covered in this workshop is freely available through the Galaxy Training Network. Presented by Simon Gladman of Australian BioCommons.

*Note: If you are on the North American west coast, this runs at 7-10 pm Pacific time on Dec 7. If you are (almost) anywhere in Asia, this is during your workday.*
</div>


<!-- Galaxy Webinars -->
<div class="card border-info" style="min-width: 16rem; max-width: 20rem">

<div class="card-header">[Galaxy Webinars](/src/events/webinars/index.md)</div>

**9 & 10 December, Online**

Interested in learning more about Galaxy [in a webinar](/src/events/webinars/index.md)?  Here's two offered this month:

**[Use Galaxy on the web, the cloud, and your laptop too](/src/events/2020-12-webinar-where/index.md)** <br />
There are *many* ways that researchers can access Galaxy. [This webinar](/src/events/2020-12-webinar-where/index.md) on **Wednesday, December 9**, will introduce participants to a range of options for using Galaxy instances around the world, and on your own laptop too.

**[Plant genomics: chloroplast genome assembly using Galaxy Australia](https://www.biocommons.org.au/events/chloroplastgenomeassembly)** <br />
You can also see Galaxy, in action, in **another webinar 12 hours later**: Anna Syme of Australian BioCommons will present a [webinar on plant genomics and genome assembly](https://www.biocommons.org.au/events/chloroplastgenomeassembly).
</div>

<!-- Submission to ENA -->
<div class="card border-info"  style="min-width: 16rem; max-width: 20rem;">
<div class="card-header">[Simplified submission of SARS-CoV-2 data to open databases](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2020/11/20/elixir-post/)</div>

[ELIXIR Belgium](https://www.elixir-belgium.org/), in collaboration with the European Galaxy project (de.NBI) and the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/), have developed a tool to simplify the submission of viral sequencing data to the [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), an ELIXIR Core Data Resource providing open access to nucleotide sequences. The new submission tool offers an easy-to-use interface, guides researchers through the submission process and verifies the data format and description. Read more in the [official ELIXIR press release](https://elixir-europe.org/news/ENA-new-tool-COVID-19-data).

<div class="card-header">[Images stored in local OMERO instances are now accessible from Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2020/11/23/OMERO-post/)</div>

Good news for the imaging community! The [IDR Download tool](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/idr_download_by_ids/idr_download_by_ids/) can now download images from a local OMERO instance.

This is an important step towards the accessibility of bioimage data. Now, images stored in local OMERO databases that are not publicly available are accessible from either public or private Galaxy instances. Imaging facilities that are running their local instance and want to perform image analysis in Galaxy can directly benefit from this new feature.
