# Galaxy Platforms News

The [Galaxy Platform Directory](/src/use/index.md) lists resources for easily running your analysis on Galaxy, including publicly available servers, cloud services, and containers and VMs that run Galaxy.  A lot was added in March:



## Galaxy Platforms in Publications

We tag papers that use, mention, implement or extend public Galaxy platforms (servers, services, clouds, containers...).  Here are the platforms that were referenced at least twice in the past month's publications:

# Releases

New additions to (and editions in) the Galaxy Ecosystem.

## Planemo 0.60.0

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/planemo-logo.png" alt="Planemo" width="200" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo/)

[Planemo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo) is a set of command-line utilities to assist in building tools for the Galaxy project.  These releases included [numerous fixes and enhancements](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).

See [GitHub for details](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).

## Pulsar 0.11.0

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/)

[Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.

## ephemeris 0.10.0

[Ephemeris](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ephemeris) is a small Python library and set of scripts for managing the bootstrapping of Galaxy plugins - tools, index data, and workflows. It has [extensive documentation](https://ephemeris.readthedocs.org/).  This [release](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ephemeris/blob/master/HISTORY.rst) features numerous newly contributed features.
