**The [2019 Galaxy Community Conference](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) starts on Monday, 1 July.**  *And we are all very excited, dang it!*

* If you haven't registered yet, then [you still can](/src/events/gcc2019/registration/index.md).  We still have space in the training sessions on Monday, as well as in the conference itself on Tuesday through Thursday.
* We still have poster and demo space (although not much).  [Submit an abstract right now](/src/events/gcc2019/abstracts/index.md).
* We have opened a [call for late-breaking lightning talks].  Space is tight, but we can get a few on the schedule.  Submit your idea now.
* There are more [talks, posters, demos, BoFs and training at GCC2019](https://gcc2019.sched.com/) then at any GCC before it.

See you in Freiburg!

# Galaxy Platforms News

The [Galaxy Platform Directory](/src/use/index.md) lists resources for easily running your analysis on Galaxy, including publicly available servers, cloud services, and containers and VMs that run Galaxy.  A lot was added in March:

## UseGalaxy.eu News

* [UseGalaxy.eu Tool Updates for 2019-06-21](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2019/06/21/tool-update/), usegalaxy.eu is getting ready for GCC 2019
* [TIaaS Queue Status](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2019/06/17/tiaas-queue/), using UseGalaxy.eu’s Training infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS).
* [Native support for Elixir-AAI in Galaxy v.19.05](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2019/06/13/elixir-aai-done/): the European Galaxy Server hosted by Elixir Germany is now ready to accept logins from users using their Elixir AAI identity for authentication.

## Galaxy Platforms in Publications

We tag papers that use, mention, implement or extend public Galaxy platforms (servers, services, clouds, containers...).  Here are the platforms that were referenced at least twice in the past month's publications:

# Releases

New additions to (and editions in) the Galaxy Ecosystem.

## Galaxy v 19.05

The May 2019 Galaxy release comes with [additional user-facing release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.05/releases/19.05_announce_user.html), and the [full release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.05/releases/19.05_announce.html) as well.  Big improvements in this release include a rewrite of the login and registration system, and improvements in workflow expressivity.

## Pulsar 0.13.0

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/)

[Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.
