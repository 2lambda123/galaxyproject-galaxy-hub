[The Language Applications (LAPPS) Grid](http://www.lappsgrid.org) provides an infrastructure for rapid development of natural language processing applications (NLP) that uses the Galaxy platform as its workflow engine. The LAPPS Grid has integrated a wide range of NLP tools and resources, including popular public tools such as [StanfordNLP](https://github.com/stanfordnlp), [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/), [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/), [LingPipe](http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/index.html), etc., into Galaxy and provided for using them interoperably in a “plug-and-play” environment. 

*The LAPPS Grid team intends to seek funding for a project that would create customizable NLP applications that can be used to mine scientific literature.* The project is motivated by requests from scientists in several disciplines who want to extract entities, relations, networks, and ontologies from scientific publications, as well as identify articles in the scientific literature that have treated particular topics or dealt with entities of interest. While some text mining facilities for the biomedical domain have been developed over the past few years, there is far less support for text mining in the other sciences. Furthermore, most available software requires considerable skill to use effectively, especially where customization to a particular task or topic is required.
 
The LAPPS Grid provides an ideal platform to support mining scientific literature. The Galaxy interface and the interoperability among our tools together provide an intuitive and easy-to-use platform. Users can experiment with and exploit NLP tools and resources without the need to determine which are suited to a particular task, and without the need for significant computer expertise. In addition, because Galaxy already includes powerful analytic and visualization software originally intended for genomics research, information extracted from texts using the LAPPS Grid could be fed to these tools without leaving the platform. Finally, like Galaxy, the LAPPS Grid is open source and free for use by anyone, and can be run from the web, on a user’s laptop or desktop, in the cloud, or as a self-contained docker image when it is necessary to protect sensitive data.  

The project we plan to propose will develop several out-of-the-box workflows for information extraction and provide facilities to adapt them to data for specific disciplines, for example by providing means to rapidly bootstrap custom dictionaries and gazetteers. As such specialized dictionaries and the like are created, we will make them available within the LAPPS Grid, thus providing an ever-expanding library of resources for mining scientific literature. We will also upload major scientific publication databases (PubMed, BioMed, PLoS, etc. as permissions allow) to [Jetstream](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) on a daily or weekly basis, as deemed appropriate, and enable queries with Apache Solr. Finally, we will provide online tutorials as well as one-day workshops to bring scientists up to speed on which tools are best suited to their tasks and how to use them within Galaxy. 

In general, we plan to provide NLP resources in response to the expressed needs of the scientific community as the project goes on. We hope to include members of the scientific community as (funded) partners in the project to suggest and test use cases and ultimately demonstrate the use of the LAPPS Grid in their own research, if possible.

*To support our effort, the LAPPS Grid project seeks input from members of the scientific community, in order to ascertain the extent of the need for the capabilities we hope to provide and, eventually, to justify our funding request. To that end, we would like to ask anyone who has an interest in the capabilities described here, or would be interested in being a partner in the project, to send an email indicating your support and, if possible, your reasons for considering this to be a worthy project.
