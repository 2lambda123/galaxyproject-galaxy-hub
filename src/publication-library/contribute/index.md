It takes a fair amount of work to keep track of publications that reference Galaxy in some way: There are now over 1000 papers per year that do so.  The bulk of this curation is currently done by [Galaxy Team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md) members using (quite possibly hundreds) of email alerts and custom software.

If you want to help curate papers then here's how you can help.

(*If you are interested in curating Galaxy publications in a serious way then please contact outreach@galaxyproject.org and we'll work with you to make you a high-throughput supernova of a curator.*)

# Zotero

We use the [Zotero](https://zotero.org/) social bookmarking service to organize publications that are about, use, or reference Galaxy.  The [Galaxy Group on Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/galaxy) is open to any community member who [would like to contribute](/src/publication-library/contribute/index.md).

# Set Up

To help out you'll need to:

1. Get a Zotero account.
1. Install the Zotero client on your laptop.
1. Download the Galaxy group to your Zotero client
1. Install the Zotero Connector in your web browser
1. Read this page carefully.
1. Request update access to the Galaxy Zotero Group

## Get a Zotero account 

If you don't already have a Zotero account, you'll need to [set one up](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/). You'll need to confirm your account through your email.  You can use the free acount: you won't need any storage for this work as we don't store PDFs in the Galaxy Group.

## Install the Zotero client on your computer

To add publications you'll need to [download and install](https://www.zotero.org/download/) the Zotero Client.  The client is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

## Install the Zotero Connector in your web browser

The Zotero Connect adds a button to your browser's menu to send the publication you are currently viewing to the Zotero client on your computer.  The Connector automatically imports a wealth of metadata from most publishers.

(You can also enter information manually, or import BibTeX, but that's a bad default option.)

The [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/) is available for for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.  A [bookmarklet](https://www.zotero.org/downloadbookmarklet) is also available for other browsers, tablets, and phones.

## Read this page carefully

Especially the guidelines below.

## Request update access to the Galaxy Zotero Group

Once you are setup and understand the guidelines below, request update access the Galaxy Zotero Group.  This can be done by [TODO].
