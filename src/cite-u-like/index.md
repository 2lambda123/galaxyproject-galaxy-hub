## Galaxy and CiteULike

The Galaxy Project uses the [CiteULike](http://citeulike.org) social bookmarking service to organize papers that are about, use, or reference Galaxy.

CiteULike supports *groups* which allow individuals to build a collaborative *library* of references. Libraries represent a set of papers that the group has flagged as relevant to group's purpose.

The [Galaxy Group](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/order/to_read,desc,) is open to any CiteULike user. After joining this group, you can add papers to the group, assign tags, and rate papers.

## CiteULike Tags

CiteULike makes extensive use of *tags* to categorize papers and enable smarter searching. The Galaxy Group uses [this set of tags](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tags) (some detailed below) to categorize papers in the Galaxy Group library.

| Tag | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| [methods](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tag/methods) | Papers that used Galaxy in their methods. |
| [project](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tag/project) | Papers that are about the project or Main. Galaxy is the central theme of these papers.|
| [isgalaxy](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tag/isgalaxy) | Papers that are about other installations of Galaxy. |
| [shared](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tag/shared) |  Papers that have published workflows, histories, datasets, pages, or visualizations in a Galaxy instance. |
| [reproducibility](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tag/reproducibility) | Papers about reproducibility and persistence in science. |
| [cloud\*](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tag/cloud) | Papers with an emphasis on using compute clouds. |
| [howto](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tag/howto) | Papers about how to use Galaxy for specific analyses. |
| [visualization\*](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tag/visualization) | Papers with an emphasis on visualization and/or visual analytics. |

\*Tag was added in 2013 so older papers won't have these tags.

Every paper should have at least one tag (even if it is just "[other](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/tag/other)"), and papers can have more than one tag. Tagged papers are listed in [approximate order of relevance to the Galaxy project](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/order/to_read,,). See [Citing Galaxy](/src/citing-galaxy/index.md) for how to cite the Galaxy Project itself.

## Want to Help?

To help the Galaxy community identify relevant papers, you can add papers to the [Galaxy Group library](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/order/to_read,desc,) and rate papers that are currently in the library.

We particularly need help with papers that were published before 2011!

## No more Mendeley

![Mendeley](/src/images/logos/MendeleyLogo.png)

The [Galaxy CiteULike Group](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/order/group_rating) was originally mirrored to a Galaxy Mendeley Group on a weekly basis, complete with the [CiteULike tag set](/src/cite-u-like/index.md#citeulike-tags).  However, in February 2013, Mendeley stopped supporting their CiteULike to Mendeley bridge, thus greatly increasing the amount of work needed to maintain the mirror. Further complicating things, later that spring Mendeley was purchased by a traditionally closed access publisher. **As of February 2013, the Mendeley Galaxy mirror is no longer maintained.**
