title: Galaxy Project Stats

This page contains statistics about the [Galaxy Project](/src/galaxy-project/index.md).  This page is updated every January and July, or whenever the project has a grant due, or whenever an advisory board meeting is set to occur.



# Community Support Channels

## Galaxy BioStar

The [Galaxy Biostar forum](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/) was launched on April 23, 2014.  Every thread that existed in the [Galaxy-User mailing list](/src/galaxy-project/statistics/index.md#mailing-lists) was copied to Galaxy Biostar at that time, and people were strongly advised to post future questions to Galaxy Biostar.  On June 6, 2014, all posting to Galaxy-User was suspended.

The statistics here don't reflect just what's happened since the switch, but also what happened (sort of) on Galaxy-User before the switch.  As more time passes, results, and especially the recent numbers will more accurately reflect what's happening on Galaxy Biostar.

All date ranges here are from Biostar.  For example, the "last 12 months" means anything that Biostar identifies as having happened between now and "12 months ago", inclusive.

## Active Users

## Mailing Lists

Membership in and traffic on Galaxy's [Mailing Lists](/src/mailing-lists/index.md) has seen steady increase over time.  Several milestones have contributed to this and affected membership and posting.

* 2011/12: Galaxy-Announce list launched.
* 2012/02: Default mailing list for newly registered users on [usegalaxy.org](/src/main/index.md) was switched from Galaxy-User to Galaxy-Announce in mid 2012/02. At the same time a link to the other lists was also added to the registration form.
* 2012/08: Galaxy-France list launched.
* 2013/06: Galaxy-Proteomics list launched.
* 2014/04: Most of Galaxy-User traffic moved to the [Galaxy Biostar online forum](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org).
* 2014/06: Galaxy-User mailing list disabled.  All new user support traffic now goes to Galaxy Biostar

# Galaxy Servers

## Main Usage

[Main](/src/main/index.md) is the Galaxy project's publicly available Galaxy server.

## Known Publicly Accessible Servers

Most [local installations of Galaxy](/src/admin/get-galaxy/index.md) are private.  However, some are not and we do keep a list of known [Public Galaxy Servers](/src/public-galaxy-servers/index.md).  These servers allow public access, although sometimes with restrictions.  This is not an absolute count, but it is a rough measure of the trend.

# Publications / Citations

A Galaxy [CiteULike](/src/cite-u-like/index.md) group was started in late 2011.  It lists all the publications that are about, reference, or mention Galaxy that we know about.  We started keeping track of this statistic partway through 2011, so it is an undercount for that year and previous years.  For years after 2011, it is likely to be more accurate, but it is still approximate and likely to be an undercount.

As of January 2017 these are the tags on papers in the Galaxy CiteULike Group:

| Tag                    | This year | Since 2011       |

# Code

Two measures of how vibrant a project is the number of code commits, and the number of people committing code to the project.  **[Open HUB](https://www.openhub.net/p/galaxybx/) provides nice summaries of [commits](https://www.openhub.net/p/galaxybx/commits/summary) and [committers](https://www.openhub.net/p/galaxybx/contributors)** that span [all of the Galaxy Project repos on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/). Open HUB also has [lines of code over time, broken down by programming language](https://www.openhub.net/p/galaxybx/analyses/latest/languages_summary) and an interesting [Factoids page](https://www.openhub.net/p/galaxybx/factoids).

# Twitter

The Galaxy project started to [use Twitter](/src/galaxy-on-twitter/index.md) on a regular basis in February 2011.  Since then, the number of followers has climbed steadily.
