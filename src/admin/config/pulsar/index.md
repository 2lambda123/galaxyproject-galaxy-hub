Pulsar (formerly the light-weight runner, LWR) is a Python web server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Input files, scripts, and config files are transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server.
