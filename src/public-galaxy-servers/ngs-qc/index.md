## Comments

* Evaluate the quality of ChIP-seq and enrichment-related NGS datasets using [NGS-QC Generator](http://www.ngs-qc.org/), which also includes a [database with preprocessed profiles](http://www.ngs-qc.org/database.php) and a [tutorial on how to analyze sequencing profiles yourself](http://www.ngs-qc.org/tutorial.php).
