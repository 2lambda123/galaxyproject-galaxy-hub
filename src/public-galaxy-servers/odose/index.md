## Comments

* "The web-based graphical user-interface ODoSE (Ortholog Direction of Selection Engine) identifies all orthologs between a set of strains and allows the calculation of a novel extension of the [McDonald Kreitman] MK test, the Direction of Selection (DoS) statistic as well as the calculation of the Neutrality Index (NI) statistic for all genes shared by two taxonomic groups combined. The engine also generates the site frequency spectrum for each gene allowing one to apply more advanced methods for estimating the distribution of fitness effects and rates of adaptive evolution."<br />
