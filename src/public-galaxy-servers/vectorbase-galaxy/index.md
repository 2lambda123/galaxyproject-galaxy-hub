## Comments

* from [VectorBase: an updated bioinformatics resource for invertebrate vectors and other organisms related with human diseases](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/12/15/nar.gku1117.full), Gloria I. Giraldo-Calder√≥n *et al.*, *Nucleic Acids Ressearch* (2014) doi: 10.1093/nar/gku1117:
*   "[VectorBase](http://vectorbase.org/) has also made available the latest relevant canonical data in this Galaxy instance. Examples of workflow analyses include alignment of Next Generation Sequence (NGS) data sets, calculation of expression values, or predicting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Registered users can store their raw data, intermediate files and final analysis results for download or direct sharing via the BRC, which greatly improves the ability to collaborate with colleagues and VectorBase developers."
