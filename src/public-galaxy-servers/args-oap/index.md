## Comments

* Integrated "ARDB and CARD, the two most commonly used databases. SARG was curated to remove redundant sequences and optimized to facilitate query sequence identification by similarity. A database with a hierarchical structure (type-subtype-reference sequence) was then constructed to facilitate classification (assigning ARG-like sequence to type, subtype and reference sequence) of sequences identified through similarity search." The server utilizes the SARG DB and a hybrid functional gene annotation pipeline to do fast annotation and classification of ARG-like sequences from metagenomic data.
