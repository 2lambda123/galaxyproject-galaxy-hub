  * provides access to up-to-date tools and algorithms such as those devoted to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis of:
    * Epigenome: MACS, Homer
    * Genomic sequence: GATK, Samtools, BEDtools, Picard
    * Transcriptome: Cufflinks, HTSeq, TopHat
    * Statistical analyses: DeepTools, S-mart, DESeq
  * [GalaxEast](http://www.galaxeast.fr) provides access to workflows developed for:
    * Motif search
    * Repetitive element analyses
    * ChIP-seq data analysis
  * [GalaxEast](http://www.galaxeast.fr) aims at providing a large range of bioinformatics tools for the analysis of various types of Omics data. It supports reproducible computational research by providing an environment for performing and recording bioinformatics analyses.
  * The [GalaxEast](http://www.galaxeast.fr) project has the following main objectives:
    * Provide the academic scientific community with an open and powerful Galaxy instance with a guaranteed availability. The platform offers access to cutting-edge and up-to-date tools for Omics data analysis with help and support.
    * Propose innovative developments and new helpful tools packaged for Galaxy (available in the GalaxEast toolshed)
    * Promote the packaging of new developments for Galaxy (through wrappers and/or toolshed packages).
