## Comments

* Proteomics Informed by Transcriptomics (PIT) methodology is described in [Evans et al. 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142869)
* "Galaxy-based Integrated Omics (GIO) is a curated collection of new and pre-existing open source tools brought together for proteomics applications."
