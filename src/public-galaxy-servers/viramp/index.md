## Comments

* from [VirAmp: a galaxy-based viral genome assembly pipeline](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/4/1/19), Yinan Wan, Daniel W Renner, Istvan Albert and Moriah L Szpara, *[GigaScience](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/)* 2015, 4:19  doi:10.1186/s13742-015-0060-y
*   [VirAmp](http://viramp.com/) "combines existing tools and techniques and presents them to end users via a web-enabled Galaxy interface. Our pipeline allows users to assemble, analyze, and interpret high coverage viral sequencing data with an ease and efficiency that was not possible previously. Our software makes a large number of genome assembly and related tools available to life scientists and automates the currently recommended best practices into a single, easy to use interface. We tested our pipeline with three different datasets from human herpes simplex virus (HSV)."
