## Comments

* Includes tools for stem cell gene list comparisons. From the web site:
  * Compare your genes to curated experiments from the [SCDE Bioinvestigation Index](http://discovery.hsci.harvard.edu/bioinvindex/)
  * Compare your uploaded list ([SCDE ListMatch](http://discovery.hsci.harvard.edu/galaxy/tool_runner?tool_id=SCDEListMatch)) or multiple lists ([SCDE ListCompare](http://discovery.hsci.harvard.edu/galaxy/tool_runner?tool_id=SCDEListMatch)) against curated gene signatures from the [GeneSigDB](http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/genesigdb/index.jsp) and [mSigDB databases](http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp)
  * Compare your genes against pathways in [WikiPathways](http://www.wikipathways.org/), and show the overlap on a pathway diagram
