## Comments

* "[PredPharmTox](http://galaxy.predpharmtox.org/) is an e-infrastructure for Large Scale Predictive Pharmacology and Toxicology, providing easy access to chemical and omics data in toxicology and pharmacology, together with methods and predictions available via user-friendly tools."
* "The infrastructure will support open standards and be developed in close collaboration with European initiatives, and implemented as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) linking to the cloud resource of the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC). The infrastructure will enable Swedish researchers to perform world class science such as integrated pharmacology/toxicology approaches, chemical safety assessment, toxicogenomics and pharmacogenomics with mechanistic interpretations and discovery of chemically-initiated pathways, as well as including omics data in predictive toxicology and pharmacology modeling."
* Implements
  * [QuantMap tools](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci200429f) for grouping chemicals by biological activity,
  * ToxMap for visual representations of the toxicogenomic space occupied by a query signature
