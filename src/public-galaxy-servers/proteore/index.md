## Comments

* "ProteoRE (Proteomics Research Environment) aims at centrally providing the proteomics community with an online research service enabling biologists/clinicians without programming expertise to **annotate and interpret** their proteomics data through the Web."
* ProteoRE currently comprises tools (including graphical display) for:
  * Customary data manipulation (e.g. filtering, lists comparison, ID conversionâ€¦)
  * Protein list annotation (e.g. information retrieval from public resources - human species)
  * Functional analysis (e.g. GOterms frequencies, enrichment analysis) including graphical representation.
  * Pathway analysis (e.g. Reactome)
* This version also includes Galaxy generic tools and some tools from the [GalaxyP project](https://usegalaxyp.org/) that should be of great help for people who want to (re)process their MS-based proteomics data (e.g. peptide/protein identification).
