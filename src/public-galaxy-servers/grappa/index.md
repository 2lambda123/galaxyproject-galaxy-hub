## Comments

* Efforts to increase GrAPPAâ€™s functionality are underway. Features now being incorporated include:
  * a larger repertoire of pre-processing options, including Gaussian graphical models and an expanded set of correlation metrics such as mutual information
  * more powerful post-processing capabilities, for example, software tools for Bayesian analysis
  * links to related web-centric resources, e.g. GeneWeaver, so that users can seamlessly transfer data and results
