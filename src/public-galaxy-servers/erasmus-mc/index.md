## Comments

* This server supports a wealth of RNA-Seq tasks, including:
  * quantify gene expression (featureCounts, edgeR, experimental design module)
  * determine and prioritize fusion genes (star-fusion, Fuma, ifuse)
  * determine variants and annotate small variants (BAM to varscan2, Annovar)
  * detect small ncRNA derived RNAs in small RNA-seq alignments (Flaimapper)
  * Generate html user defined workflow (iReport)
* All tools are also available in the Tool Shed.
