## Comments

* [RiboGalaxy](http://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie) is a freely available web server for processing and analysing ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) data with the visualization functionality provided by [GWIPS-viz](http://gwips.ucc.ie/). RiboGalaxy provides a compact suite of tools specifically tailored for the alignment and visualization of ribo-seq and corresponding mRNA-seq data. Users can take advantage of the published workflows on RiboGalaxy which reduce the multi-step alignment process to a minimum of inputs.
