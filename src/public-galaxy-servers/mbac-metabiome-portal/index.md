## Comments

* We have developed the [MBAC Metabiome Portal](http://mbac.gmu.edu/mbac/display_detail.php?tb=research&id=11), a flexible and customizable webserver, with the aim of simplifying control, usage, access, and analysis of microbiome, metabolome, and immunome data (the Metabiome).
* The Portal uses a relational database management system and distributed analytical resources and includes several tools such as sequence clustering, filtering sequencing artifacts, taxonomic analysis, and functional annotation. Users access the MBAC Metabiome Portal through a Galaxy based web browser to perform individual and group analysis and share their results. Programming support is also available to configure and run customized pipelines.
