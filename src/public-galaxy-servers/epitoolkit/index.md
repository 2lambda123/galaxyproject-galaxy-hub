## Comments

* [EpiToolKit](http://www.epitoolkit.de/) "provides a collection of methods from computational immunology for the development of novel epitope-based vaccines including HLA ligand or potential T-Cell epitope prediction, an epitope selection framework for vaccine design, and a method to design optimal string-of-beads vaccines. Additionally, [EpiToolKit](http://www.epitoolkit.de/) provides several other tools ranging from HLA typing based on NGS data, to prediction of polymorphic peptides."

## User Support
