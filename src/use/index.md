The Galaxy Project's public server ([usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org/)) can
meet many needs, but it is not suitable for everything (see
[Choices](/src/choices/index.md) for why). Fortunately the Galaxy
[Community](/src/community/index.md) has created Galaxy instances in many different forms and for many different applications.

This is a directory of publicly accessible

* Galaxy servers,
* cloud services that support Galaxy instances, and
* virtual machines and containers that can be easily deployed for your own server.

**If you want to use Galaxy with little or no effort creating an instance, this is where you should start.**
