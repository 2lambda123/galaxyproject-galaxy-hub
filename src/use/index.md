The Galaxy Project's public server ([usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org/)) can
meet many needs, but it is not suitable for everything (see
[Choices](/src/choices/index.md) for why). Fortunately the Galaxy
[Community](/src/community/index.md) has created Galaxy instances in many different forms and for many different applications.

This is a directory of publicly accessible Galaxy servers, cloud services that support Galaxy instances, and virtual machines and containers that can be easily deployed for your own server.  *If you want to use Galaxy with little or no effort creating an instance, this is where you should start.*

# Directories

* [All resources](/src/use/index.md#all-resources)
* [Resources by Scope](/src/use/index.md#by-scope)
  * [UseGalaxy](/src/use/index.md#usegalaxy)
  * [General / Genomics](/src/use/index.md#general)
  * [Domain Specific](/src/use/index.md#domain)
  * [Tool Publishing](/src/use/index.md#tool-publishing)
* [Resources by Platform](/src/use/index.md#by-platform)
  * [Public Servers](/src/use/index.md#public-servers)
  * [Commercial Cloud Services](/src/use/index.md#commercial-cloud)
  * [Academic Cloud Services](/src/use/index.md#academic-cloud)
  * [Containers](/src/use/index.md#containers)
  * [Virtual Machines (VMs)](/src/use/index.md#vms)
  * [Install Locally](/src/use/index.md#install-locally)

(*What about listing these by the resource's domain, for example, the research methodology (e.g., RNA-Seq), the clade (e.g., crops), or field e.g., metagenomics) that a resource is targeted at? We are working on it.*)

# Add a resource to this directory

If you maintain a Galaxy resource that can be listed on this directory, then please **[describe your Galaxy resource here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KBkyhAPpgJLanRWBoIHmwtEJELDUifZLUixfoqZXXU4/viewform?usp=send_form)**.
We'll contact you with any question and then post it this directory.
