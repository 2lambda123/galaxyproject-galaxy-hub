comments:
  - "Taxonomic placement: 16S rRNA gene sequence identity values; 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic tree; Taxonomic assignment based on GTDB (GTDB-Tk r89); Genomic tree (phylophlan3); ANI values (FastANI); and POCP values"
  - "Functional analysis: KEGG based pathway reconstruction; CAZyme profiling; Antibiotic resistance profiling (CARD)"
  - "Ecological analysis: Prevalence and average relative abundance across 1,000 samples for 19 unique environments (IMNGS); Occurrence based on MASH comparison to a database of >50,000 MAGs from thousands of samples"
