title: 'James Peter Taylor | 1979 - 2020'

<div class="text-right"> *Good ideas don’t have owners—they belong to everyone (@jxtx)*</div>

<br />

James Taylor started his professional path at the University of Vermont, where he received a BS in Computer Science in 2000. In 2003, after working as a software engineer in the private sector, he found that his real purpose in life was elsewhere. That year he began his graduate studies in Computer Science at Penn State and joined the nascent Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics. He used to refer to the Center as ‘BX’—a contraction of BioinformatiX. The name stuck; ‘BX’ is still a part of many URLs (e.g. the original Galaxy URL at http://g2.bx.psu.edu) and is the origin for the name of the [bx-python software package](https://github.com/bxlab/bx-python). The interdisciplinary faculty of the Center included Francesca Chiaromonte, Ross Hardison, Kateryna Makova, Webb Miller, and Anton Nekrutenko.  This group became the core of James’ academic family, a family that has now lost its most brilliant and prolific child.

James concluded his PhD work under the supervision of Webb Miller and Francesca Chiaromointe in just three years—during which he blossomed as a methods developer and as a scientist. He published extensively on comparative genome analysis, gene regulation and molecular evolution—a total of eleven papers<sup>1–11</sup> which were hugely instrumental in advancing the research of the Center.  Ross Hardison, former head of the Center, remembers:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
I may have been on James’ thesis committee, but I learned far more from him than he did from me. In those days, the major data sources for functional genomics were alignments of genome sequences from different species—a specialty of Webb Miller. James was an early developer of machine learning methods to find signals in those multi-species alignments that were predictive of gene regulatory regions. He realized that those methods required substantial dimensional reduction—a specialty of Francesca Chiaromonte—to be effective. He had an amazing command of the statistical, computational, and biological frameworks in which he was working. With his high energy and creativity, he generated effective, publicly released predictions of regulatory elements by 2006. An enduring highlight of my career was my experimental lab testing many of those predictions, and finding that an impressive portion of them did affect levels of gene expression in transfected cells. James and I continued to work together on many projects, always with the goal of finding out what is important in our genomes. It is hard to think of continuing on without him.
</blockquote>

Midway through his graduate studies James became entangled in a messy project that was given the name “GalaXY”. This name was coined by Robert Harris, a fellow graduate student and LASTZ<sup>12</sup> developer, by adding ‘X’ and ‘Y’ to the name of Galaxy’s predecessor, GALA<sup>13</sup>. GALA was the brainchild of Ross Hardison and Webb Miller, who wanted to link genome alignments and annotations and provide tools for operating on those data. They convinced James and Anton Nekrutenko to take it on as a potentially interesting side project. It is hard to pinpoint the exact time when James and Anton started working on Galaxy together, but most likely it was in the middle of a long night of random pub traversals in Glasgow, Scotland, during the 2004 annual meeting of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). 

After graduating from Penn State, James gained post-doctoral experience as a visiting member of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at the New York University (2006 - 2008). During these two years, and ever since, Galaxy became one of his principal projects. Its now iconic features such as the three-pane interface, the “noodly” workflow editor, and the dynamic genome browser Trackster, were built by James while at NYU. 

James’ move to Emory University as an assistant professor in 2008 coincided with the rapid emergence of cloud computing, and it became obvious that the future of Galaxy was cloud-dependent. Together with his new team—Enis Afgan, Dannon Baker, Kanwei Li, and Jeremy Goecks—James quickly adapted Galaxy to cloud infrastructure, making it the first comprehensive data analysis resource in Life Sciences to cross this bridge<sup>14,15</sup>. 

From the very beginning, James’ vision for the future of Galaxy was about creating and supporting a community of developers and users. This took shape with the Galaxy Developer Conference held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the summer of 2010, which has since become a yearly event that draws more than 200 attendees. He believed that to be successful and, most importantly, useful, a project must be open and cannot be owned by a single lab or a PI<sup>16</sup>. He was firmly dedicated to this idea. Today Galaxy is not associated with a particular group or an institution. It is a community effort supported by hundreds of developers worldwide. This, perhaps more than anything else, ensures that James’ legacy will endure. 

James once said that he would change his middle name to Reproducibility if it would help move the cause forward. He was an advocate for reproducible science long before it became fashionable, and he made it a central tenet of Galaxy.  He could be downright evangelical about it. Martin Morgan of Bioconductor, a collaborator on the AnVIL Project, [shared](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/129652/):

<blockquote class="blockquote">
We in the Bioconductor community knew James as a Galaxy project leader, a strong advocate for open and reproducible science, and an enthusiastic and inspirational colleague. James recognized Bioconductor as a kindred spirit, and bridged the relationship between Galaxy and Bioconductor through his leadership of the NHGRI AnVIL project. James' leadership has had deep consequences for the way Bioconductor now navigates toward large-scale cloud-based computing. 
</blockquote>

James was particularly concerned with the inadequate state of quantitative education in life sciences. He developed many of the early training materials that became the foundation of the Galaxy Training Network<sup>17</sup>. He continued to make important contributions to biomedical education after he joined the Biology Department at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in 2014. At JHU he participated in the development of massive open online courses (MOOCs), and he taught data analysis and scientific computing to biologists. 

Vince Hilser, chair of the Johns Hopkins Biology department, [describes](https://bio.jhu.edu/2020/04/03/in-memoriam-professor-james-taylor/) James as a bedrock of the department:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
He came in 2014, and it was transformational. He was this catalyst for change, with a huge positive impact. His presence in the department opened up many areas for research, as he was able to help other faculty members uncover new insights by revealing similarities between the proteins they were studying and those in other organisms. 
</blockquote>

People who worked for James thought the world of him, and many people in his group followed him from Emory to Johns Hopkins, and are still in his group today. When a new employee asked him and Anton whether it was "better to ask for permission or forgiveness" James's response was "Don't let us be a bottleneck." That was typical—always thinking of a third option where everyone else only saw two.  Enis Afgan, [in his memoriam](#a-man-who-wanted-to-live-forever-james-taylor), describes James:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
He ran his lab not as a boss but as a friend and a colleague that inspired each individual to do their best work. He was an enabler. He was someone you tried your best not to disappoint.
</blockquote>

While we celebrate James’ transformative vision of computational biology and bioinformatics, he was also just a lot of fun to be with. He had a finely tuned palate for good beer, he was an energetic and inquisitive conversationalist, and he had an uncanny ability to stay up late talking about science, politics, and all things related, but still be at his best the next morning. 
James met his future wife, Meredith Greif, when they were graduate students at Penn State. They were married in 2009. They have pursued their careers in a mutually supportive manner, him holding a faculty appointment at Emory University, and Meredith at Georgia State University. Both then moved to Johns Hopkins University. We extend our deepest sympathy to her on this shattering loss.

This memoriam can only hint at how remarkable James was as a human being. We could not capture who he was even if we were given volumes to fill. Comments have come in ([and continue to come in](#community) from all over the world, and they touch on both his humanity and his intellect. Melissa Wilson, an associate professor at Arizona State and a fellow PhD student, captures this perfectly:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
He is leaving a hole that cannot be filled. I met James when I started grad school at Penn State. I had no idea what to expect. We were both students, but he was clearly in a league of his own. James was one of the smartest people I've ever known, in a way that wasn't (as) intimidating. Talking with James was easy and enlightening. He advocated and put in the work for better science, in all aspects. James supported my science and my career in ways I don't think I can ever fully communicate. As a colleague, he believed in me. As a friend, he expected me to do good. He supported my growth, selflessly. Most of all, James was an advocate. He advocated for his students, for trainees, for open science, for open data, for making this world a better place.
</blockquote>

James hated self-promotion. For him, the biggest human flaw was baseless arrogance. He believed that everything should be based on merit, which for him meant top-notch science, technical perfection, and a healthy dose of idealism. After all, he was the brightest, most unapologetic, and kindest idealist that the Galaxy project, his students, and his many colleagues and friends will ever know. This post from Karen Reddy, a colleague at Johns Hopkins, sums it all up:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
James was, simply put, an amazing person. He was certainly an amazing scientist, but so much more than that. He was what we all hope to be as scientists, mentors, colleagues, and friends. We will miss you James.

## Initial announcement

<p class="lead">
We just lost James Taylor (1979-2020). His legacy — open, reproducible science — will continue.
</p>

James Taylor, a leader of the Galaxy Project, and one of its original members, passed away on April 2, 2020.

The community response (see below) has been tremendous, which reflects the breadth and depth of his impact.  If you have something you would like to add then please [share your thoughts here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4iKUV7r91OxRFq6DbkVpSb4ftTP4eQqhvcSl-TD-PUdvFPw/viewform), and we will add them below.

The cause of James' death is not yet known, and given how overwhelmed the medical profession is in Baltimore, we may never know.  Given how quickly this overtook him it is very unlikely to have been COVID-19.  We will add any new information here as we learn it.

Thank you for your support during this awful time,<br />
The Galaxy Project

## A man who wanted to live forever: James Taylor

By Enis Afgan,

I met James on Friday, Feb 13, 2009. Perhaps that was a sign for what’s to come. It was a job interview for my postdoc. Preparing for the interview, I had searched for a picture of James to know who to look for but I had no success. He was quite concerned about privacy and the social web of the time had not undermined his efforts. When I finally walked into his office, I saw James for the first time: a person about my age wearing jeans, a button-up shirt with top two buttons undone, and a sport coat with elbow patches. It had a somewhat raggedy appearance but elegant at the same time. I guess you’d call it edgy today. Having had a very traditional educational upbringing where faculty was referred to as Dr. This or Professor That and generally wearing professional attire, I was a bit surprised with his appearance (as you may be able to tell given I remember it a decade later). We proceeded to chat about my work and some of the Galaxy efforts he was spearheading that continue to be worked on to this day. The point of this is that James left a long-term impression on me, and it didn’t take long. He had the special ability to be concise and impactful.

Continuing in the vein of a non-traditional mentor (at least by my past experiences), we would have most of our lab meetings over dinners at pubs or at the SweetWater brewery. One particular dinner stands out. We were discussing the impact of cancer research on actual patient care. One thing led to another and the conversation evolved into a discussion about death. James, always pushing the norms, proceeded to elaborate about a not completely unrealistic path of capturing one’s consciousness in a digital format and saving it forever. With time, he argued, it would be possible to reconstruct the consciousness back into physical form and ultimately live forever. Books have been written about such topics but the point remains that James was happy alive and inspired to live forever. 

Instead, here we are. Roughly a decade later, I’m writing a eulogy to the man I admired and who has inspired me and hundreds of others to work hard and think on our own. James made a great scientific impact on the world. I am sure others will write about his scientific and technological accomplishments so instead I wanted to focus on the generous and likable human being that he was. He ran his lab not as a boss but as a friend and a colleague that inspired each individual to do their best work. He was an enabler. He was someone you tried your best not to disappoint. In addition, he taught me what is good beer so how can you not love a man like that. I’m going to miss working with you James.

## “Keep Going Until We Get Bored or the Money Runs Out”

By Jeremy Goecks

I enjoyed our conversations the most. All across the world for more than a decade, James and I would find each other at the same conferences and meetings, and we’d head out in the afternoon or evening and have wide-ranging conversations about science, politics, software engineering, medicine, lifelong goals, academia, food, alcohol, and more. He was easy to talk with, no matter how long it had been since we last spoke. He made you feel heard, and he had an intelligence and earnestness, mixed with a slightly smartass sense of humor, that was unique. When I sat down with James, I always knew I’d learn something new or come to appreciate a topic in a different way. And I’d leave the conversation with the feeling that comes when you connect with such an amazing human being. As I remember James, the feelings I had after our conversations will be the ones that I hold onto.

James was a tremendous academic scientist, which is much more impressive than it sounds. Research, teaching, and service obligations are all required of professors. Most of us do some of these things well; James did them all well and enjoyed them to boot. As you’ll hear time and again when others talk about James, he inspired people in all his roles as an academic scientist. The Galaxy Project will likely be James’ greatest professional legacy, and it is a testament to his ability to inspire. The Galaxy community of users, developers, and trainers, which is now worldwide and numbers in the tens of thousands, reflect his vision for open science and education. Through the efforts of this community, James' vision will continue to be developed and have impact far into the future.

Years ago, I asked James how long we should keep working on the Galaxy Project. At the time, Galaxy was a big deal, but there were other interesting projects we had started as well. His response was brief: “we should keep going until we get bored or the money runs out.” I didn’t really get it at the time, but now I think he may have been sharing one of his key principles for how to live. James just didn’t do stuff he wasn’t interested in, but he worked tirelessly to develop the resources he needed to live the life and do the work that he wanted. He seemed genuinely happy with his life and work, a man who was happy with what he’d accomplished but nonetheless had big plans for the future. My dear friend James, we did not get bored and the money did not run out. It’s difficult to accept that we won’t be able to keep going together, but I’m so grateful for our friendship and the time we had.

When I’m writing this I’m cautious of not exaggerating. I gave up on that. James made an enormous impact in the bioinformatics community. With Galaxy, he co-founded a platform that enabled many thousands of researchers to do reproducible analysis. Much of what I’m doing now, builds on his legacy. But even more importantly, his vision on Open Science touched many more people, most of them will never be aware of it. It fits his generosity.
<br />
James, you wanted Galaxy to belong to its Community, not just to the founders. This reflects your style of leadership, and the Community is in a good shape to face the future because of it. But having to write this now wasn’t part of the deal. I expected and looked forward to keep on working with you throughout my career.
<br />
We’ll find a way forward with the Galaxy Community. I’m not sure how yet, but I do know we’ll often refer back to you. And with time, the sorrow will dampen and we’ll think fondly back, glad to have known you.

He was also enormously good company, going out for beers and in depth discussions on any and all topics. I thoroughly enjoyed James' company in social and academic forums...but far more importantly than that, he both led and built software and data science communities that will define community-focussed global bioscience from here on. <br /><br />

My friend James Taylor is dead. I'm heartbroken and thinking of all of his family and friends. He is leaving a hole that cannot be filled.<br /><br />
I met James when I started grad school at Penn State. I had no idea what to expect (I'd only learned of PhD programs within the previous year). We were both students, but he was clearly in a league of his own.<br /><br />
James was one of the smartest people I've ever known, in a way that wasn't (as) intimidating. Talking with James was easy and enlightening. He advocated and put in the work for better science, in all aspects.<br /><br />
James supported my science and my career in ways I don't think I can ever fully communicate. As a colleague, he believed in me. As a friend, he expected me to do good. He supported my growth, selflessly.<br /><br />
Most of all, James was an advocate. <br /><br />
He advocated for his students, for trainees, for open science, for open data, for making this world a better place. <br /><br />

I will miss him so terribly.

James was so approachable. Though we never got the chance to collaborate directly, when I first met *the* James Taylor I remember feeling that approachability in that someone so famous in our field would always take the time out to talk to me about science or about whatever the topic of the moment was. We had many conversations - some just a glance across a busy crowd at a conference where that would be our only acknowledgement, some,  hours long chats. The first memory that came to mind thinking back now was the many weeks he spent at CSHL instructing at courses in the fall. There were months when he was on campus more than I was. The particular memory that flashed when I heard this news was finishing a beer with him around 2 am in the cold outside the bar at Blackford. The bar had long closed, but we were having a crazy conversation along with one other course instructor about awful American TV shows. The conversation was of course punctuated with thoughts on comparative genomics. James was brilliant, but it wasn’t this that made him a star, helped him build a global community, or an enduring vision. He was a lovable and decent human being who will be fondly remembered. His work and the community he helped to create will live on. For every researcher who continues his legacy and works to live up to his achievements, don’t forget to bring along also his charm, curiosity, compassion, and love.

I was fortunate to be introduced to James via the IU/TACC Jetstream project, where he promised to consume large quantities of CPU time on behalf of the Galaxy project. His vision and his plans for achieving it were both straightforward and clear. In short: Give us a key to your system (an API key, in this case), and we will make sure it's used for good. And he delivered, spectacularly! While this straightforward approach might at first appear naive, he articulated his plans clearly and proved soundly that he could do it. He was always ready to share examples of discoveries that had been enabled by Galaxy. In later visits on other topics, I was impressed by his astute understanding of how the research community works and how to make (important, substantive) things happen. People like him are rare and special, and a joy to encounter and work with. This is a heavy loss for the research community.

James was a great force for openness, community, and science.  He was a truly lovely man. I first met him in Oslo in 2013 and he was immediately welcoming even though he had no idea who I was.

The thing I'll most remember about him is the glint of pride he got in his eye whenever he saw the wonderful Galaxy community get together. He and Anton created something amazing.<br /><br />
