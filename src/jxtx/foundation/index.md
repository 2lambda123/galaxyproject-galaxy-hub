These are the words that James Taylor (JT) said and lived by. This, he believed, was imperative to advance science, and in a way that facilitated diversity and inclusion. The mission of this foundation is to continue his legacy, through a multifaceted approach which will be unrolled across several stages.

## Recent Foundation Activity and News

The Foundation's first activity has been to sponsor 10 graduate students to attend the 2020 Biological Data Science Conference at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  Awards were competitive and and we are delighted with our first round of scholarships:

In its early stages, JTech will provide support for graduate students to attend conferences in computational biology and data science, where they can present their work and form connections with other researchers in the field. Towards the goal of advancing mentorship, JTech will organize and host mentoring sessions between senior and junior faculty members at select high-profile meetings.

JTech will later expand its reach as a platform for academic mentorship. First, it will operate to spark mentoring relationships among the larger computational biology and data science community. As part of membership in JTech, faculty and students will have an opportunity to participate in periodic mentorship meetings (virtually). We expect an enthusiastic response to this opportunity, and will recruit additional team members to provide organizational structure if necessary.

In its later stages, JTech will sponsor in-person visits from students (high school or college age) to its hotspots, which currently include Johns Hopkins and Penn State. These visits are meant to attract new scholars to computational biology and data science, and in particular to form connections and opportunities for members of underrepresented minorities.
