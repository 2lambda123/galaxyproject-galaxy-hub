# My History is missing!

If you were working with an unregistered account, the History could really be now lost to you_. [Get Registered](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/support/account) before starting again!

**Find any History**

    *   Locate the History menu gear icon at top of right History panel in the "Analyze Data" view
    *   Select the option "Saved Histories" from this pull-down menu
    *   At the top of the list in the middle panel, click into "Advanced Search"
    *   Select "status: all" to see all of your active, deleted, and permanently deleted histories.
        *   Histories in all states are archived for a fairly long time for registered accounts. Meaning, one will always find their data here if it ever appears to be "lost".
