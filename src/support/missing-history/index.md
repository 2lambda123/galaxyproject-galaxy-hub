# My History is missing!

If you were working with an unregistered account, the History could really be now lost to you_. [Get Registered](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/support/account) before starting again!

**Find any History in your account**

    *   Locate the History menu gear icon at top of right History panel in the "Analyze Data" view
    *   Select the option "Saved Histories" from this pull-down menu
    *   At the top of the list in the middle panel, click into "Advanced Search"
    *   Select "status: all" to see all of your active, deleted, and permanently deleted histories.
    *   Histories in all states are archived but still listed for registered accounts at http://usegalaxy.org. _Meaning one will always find their data here if it ever appears to be "lost"_.
    *   The exception can be if History has been **purged**. This requires a _double-confirmed user action_. Permenently deleted/purged Histories may be removed from the server at any time. The content is removed at the time of purging (and cannot be retrieved), but the History may still be in the list for reference, for some variable time period.
        
# Someone shared a history with me, where do I find it?

When logged into your account, these are located under **_Histories Shared with Me_** (a History menu option). 

**Working with _Histories Shared with Me_**

    *   _Make copies_ to import the history into your account where they can be worked with.
    *   _Unshare histories_ that you no longer want shared with you or that you have already made a copy of.
    *   _Shared Histories_ (but not copied) do count in portion toward your [total account data quota(https://galaxyproject.org/main/#user-data-and-job-quotas) at http://usegalaxy.org.
