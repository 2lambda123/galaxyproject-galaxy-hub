## Job and Tool Error Help

So you started a job and it ended up failing. The result datasets are red in the history. 

What to do? It depends on the **failure type** and where you are using Galaxy. 

 * The advice on this page is primarily about errors at [Galaxy Main](/src/main/index.md). 
 * In particular, the cluster help is server specific. 
 * But good news! The general troubleshooting help applies to any Galaxy server/tool.
