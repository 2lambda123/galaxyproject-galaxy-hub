# Using Galaxy

## Galaxy NGS 101

The Big Picture: **[Galaxy NGS 101](/src/learn/galaxy-ngs101/index.md)**

## Learning Hub

See our [Learning](/src/learn/index.md) hub for key coverage of Galaxy user interface concepts, data, and tools. Review "Shared Data/Published Pages" on the [Main](/src/main/index.md) server [usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org) for publication supplementals and tutorials.

## Screencasts

[Screencast](/src/learn/screencasts/index.md) videos demonstrate the step-by-step for a range of topics. Packed with tips and methods usable across analysis workflows plus presentations and tutorials for administrations, these are a great resource for both the scientific and technical Galaxy communities.

## Custom Searches

Looking for something specific? Try ***[Galaxy Custom Searches](/src/news/custom-galaxy-search/index.md)*** with a keyword or phrase. The ***[MailingList](http://galaxyproject.org/search/mailinglists)*** search finds all related prior Q & A from the [Galaxy Biostar](/src/support/index.md#biostar) forum and any [Galaxy Project mailing lists](/src/mailing-lists/index.md). The ***[UseGalaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/search/usegalaxy)*** search finds all online resources for information about using Galaxy.  This includes this wiki, tool help and shared Galaxy objects at [UseGalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org), and [Mailing Lists](/src/mailing-lists/index.md).

## Biostar

Galaxy has teamed up with [Biostar](http://biostars.org) to create a Galaxy User support forum at **[https://biostar.usegalaxy.org](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org)**.
<br />
 **[How to login and use...](/src/support/biostar/index.md)**
<div class='right'><a href='https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/'><img src="/src/images/logos/GalaxyBiostar.png" alt="Galaxy Biostar" width="250" /></a></div>
We want to create a space where researchers using Galaxy can come together and share both scientific advice and practical tool help.  Whether on **[http://usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org)**, a **[Cloudman](http://usegalaxy.org/cloud)** instance, or any **[other](/src/public-galaxy-servers/index.md) [Galaxy](http://getgalaxy.org)**, if you have something to say about **Using Galaxy**, this is the place to do it!

## Mailing Lists

Galaxy has one public mailing lists for questions, one private mailing list for bug reports, and one announcement mailing list. Please do not post questions through the **[Galaxy Issue Board](/src/issues/index.md)**; these will only be redirected. Manage subscriptions and learn more about these list at the **[Mailing Lists](/src/mailing-lists/index.md)** home page. See also:

* [Reporting/vetting a software bug](/src/support/index.md#reporting_a_software_bug)

Note: The galaxy-user mailing list has been retired. Galaxy scientific user and tool help has moved to **[Galaxy Biostar](/src/support/biostar/index.md)**. 

## IRC Channel

Galaxy also has an IRC channel in which you can participate.  You can connect to the chat directly via browser  [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#galaxyproject). This IRC channel is an informal online gathering place for the Galaxy community to post questions and help each other out.

Alternatively you can use the Gitter [channel](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby) which is mirrored to the IRC.

The #galaxyproject IRC channel has an [online public archive](https://botbot.me/freenode/galaxyproject/) (starting 2014/10/22) and these archives are included in the Galaxy [search engines](http://galaxyproject.org/search/web).
