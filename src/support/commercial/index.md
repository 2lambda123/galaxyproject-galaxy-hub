Galaxy is a powerful and open, web-based platform, which is accessible to all scientists. For the beginner, it can be difficult to know how to select from the thousands of available tools, which ones are right for your data analysis. 

In addition, for microbiology, few public Galaxy servers are available and their use could limited to subscribers or collaborators only. Many tools, which specially designed for microbiology, are not available in Galaxy main.

At [Noor Biotechnologies](http://noorbiotech.com/) we support your genomics research by:

1. Helping you identifying the correct genomics applications that answer your research questions.
2. Providing support in the design of your sequencing experiment.
3. [Training](/src/support/commercial/index.md#training) you in using Galaxy for high throughput data analysis.
4. Providing help in selecting the correct bioinformatics tools and work workflows on either public Galaxy servers or to customize your own local Galaxy server.
5. Offering a deep understanding of microbial genomics. 

With [Noor Biotechnologies](http://noorbiotech.com/), you can make sense of your microbial genomics data

<div class='right'><img src="/src/images/logos/bioteam-appliance-white.png" alt="BioTeam Appliance Galaxy Edition" width="250" /></div>

<blockquote>
a push-button solution that letâ€™s researchers get up and running quickly with Galaxy.  The Galaxy Appliance comes preinstalled with a production instance of Galaxy, bioinformatics tools, and reference datasets. This powerful system is specifically configured for computationally intensive scientific workloads. Most importantly, the Galaxy Appliance is an open system so researchers and can install whatever tools they need and use the server as their own high-performance informatics infrastructure outside of Galaxy. [BioTeam](http://www.bioteam.net/) provides ongoing support for the Galaxy Appliance, enabling researchers to minimize their IT burden. The Galaxy Appliance is used by researchers around the world for metagenomic, ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq analysis and more.

</div>

[CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md) and [Globus Genomics](/src/cloud/index.md#globus-genomics) are two ways to deploy your own Galaxy server using [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com). CloudMan can also run on any cloud provider that supports the [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) or [OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org) cloud management protocols.  This covers the vast majority of commercial cloud providers.

See the Galaxy [Cloud](/src/cloud/index.md) page for more.
