# Registering for a Galaxy account

Having your own account on the public **[Test](/src/test)** and/or **[Main](/src/main)** server means that you can save histories, work with more data, associate an [OpenID](/learn/OpenID%20Login), and get the most out of Galaxy's functionality. 

Be sure to note that the public [Test](/src/test) and [Main](/src/main) instance **usage policies are <span class="red">one account per user<span class="grey"></span></span>**, as stated in our **[Terms and Conditions](https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html)**. Also, make sure your email address is valid so that you can confirm your new account (emails are case sensitive) and so that our administrator can contact you if needed (rare, but you'll want the email!). 

More details **[here](/src/support#Dataset_and_History_Guides)**.

Watch the **[Accounts on Main](http://vimeo.com/galaxyproject/accounts)** video for a quick how-to.

Admin settig up an instance? See our **[User Accounts](src/admin/user-accounts/)** wiki for more help.
