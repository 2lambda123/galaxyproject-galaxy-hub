# Galaxy Documentation

Galaxy Project consists of dozens of endeavours many of which are trying to capture the intents and means by providing documentation.

## Releases

Each release has curated [notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/index.html) with highlights and summaries.

## Administration

Documentation with regards to administering Galaxy is currently scattered among few places. Some topics are at the main [docs](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/index.html) site, others at the administrator's training [repository](https://github.com/martenson/dagobah-training/) and some at this [hub](/src/admin/index.md).

## Docs with code

1. API - The application programming interface [documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/api_doc.html).
1. Framework - The Python framework [documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/lib/modules.html).
