title: Galaxy Mailing Lists
---
Mailing lists play a vital role in the Galaxy community:

1. They are a key part of [Galaxy's overall support efforts](/src/support/index.md).
1. **They complement the [Galaxy Biostar forum](/src/support/biostar/index.md), which is focused on questions about *using* Galaxy.**
1. They are a place where the community *[can ask and answer](/src/mailing-lists/index.md#posting-a-question)* questions.
1. They are a place for the discussion of open issues and best practices.
1. They are also a *[searchable treasure trove of knowledge about Galaxy](/src/mailing-lists/index.md#searching)*.  
1. Finally, they are a great way to learn what is going on in the Galaxy Community.

**For questions about *using Galaxy* please use the [Galaxy Biostar forum](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/).  See the [Biostar hub page](/src/support/biostar/index.md) for more on how to use [Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/) and its integration with [usegalaxy.org](/src/main/index.md).**

(The Galaxy-User mailing was migrated to the [Galaxy Biostar forum](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/) in Spring 2014.  All posts to Galaxy-User were migrated to the [forum](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/) at that time.) 



# The lists

Galaxy has several active mailing lists, each for a different purpose in the Galaxy community.

## New to Mailing Lists?

If you are brand new to mailing lists, you might want to read *[Ten Simple Rules for Getting Help from Online Scientific Communities](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202)* by Dall'Olio *et al.* ([PLoS Comput Biol 7(9): e1002202. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002202](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202)) Don't be intimidated by there being ten rules.  The most important rule is:

* **[Rule 1. Do Not Be Afraid to Ask a Question](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s2)** - Really. Be bold.

Once you have mastered Rule 1, you can refine your mailing list chops by applying the other 9 rules:

* **[Rule 2. State the question clearly](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s3)**
* **[Rule 3. Learn the established customs of the list](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s4)**
* **[Rule 4. Do not ask what has already been answered](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s5)** - Take advantage of the [mailing list search engines](/src/mailing-lists/index.md#searching).<br />
* **[Rule 5. Always use a good title](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s6)**
* **[Rule 6. Do your homework before posting](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s7)**
* **[Rule 7. Proofread your post](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s8)**
* **[Rule 8. Be courteous to other forum members](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s9)**
* **[Rule 9. The archive of your discussion will be useful to others](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s10)**
* **[Rule 10. Give back to the community](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202#s11)** - Help answer others' questions and [Get Involved](/src/get-involved/index.md)!

## New to Open Source Software Support Mailing Lists?

If you are brand new to programming mailing lists please read
**[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way by Eric Steven Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)** for practical tips on writing programming questions to this or any other open source mailing list. 

<span style="font-size: smaller;"> Hint for those too lazy to click: only you know useful information about the problem context such as the software packages and versions involved. A good question includes the bare minimum context detail, allowing someone who is skilled in the art and reading the list to understand the problem. </span>

# Mailing List Traffic

We have a significant amount of mailing list traffic. See the [Galaxy Project Statistics](/src/galaxy-project/statistics/index.md#traffic) page for more information.
