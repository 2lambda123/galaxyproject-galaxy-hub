# Galaxy Community Hub [![Build Status](https://jenkins.galaxyproject.org/buildStatus/icon?job=galaxy-hub)](https://jenkins.galaxyproject.org/job/galaxy-hub/)

Source for the [Galaxy Hub Website (galaxyproject.org)](https://galaxyproject.org/).  The Galaxy Hub is the community and documentation hub for the Galaxy Project.  It is maintained by the community through this GitHub repository.  It is a static website built using the [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) static site generator.

## About the Galaxy Project.

We could describe it here, but really, see the web site that is generated from this repository: [galaxyproject.org](https://galaxyproject.org).  That will save a lot of typing.

## Should I access the Galaxy Hub website through GitHub or  galaxyproject.org?

The only reason to navigate through the website in GitHub is if you updating the web site (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](contributing.md)).  If you just want to read and explore the web site, then you should absolutely do that through [galaxyproject.org](https://galaxyproject.org).  The web site is not quite correctly rendered in the GitHub web site: it is missing some magic metalsmith, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome bits that are added when the site is generated.

## Finally,

Thanks for using Galaxy!
