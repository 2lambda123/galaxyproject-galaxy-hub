#### **Maintenance: Dynamic job router switch**

The European Galaxy server will switch to a new job router, [Total Perspective Vortex](https://total-perspective-vortex.readthedocs.io/).
It helps us to keep resource management simple and in-sync with other usegalaxy.* instances.
We have thoroughly tested our new setup. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that there may be temporary disruptions in job routing and that some jobs may not start.

The switch is effective as of now, May 3rd 4 pm CEST, and we will try to resolve any issues from it as fast as possible and expect to be back to normal operation by tomorrow May 4th at the latest.
