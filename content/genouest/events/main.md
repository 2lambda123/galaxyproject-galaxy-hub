## The Event Horizon is still migrating

This page won't have all historical posts until we're done moving content from the old host.

This is the home for new GenOuest events, but if you're looking for older content, you can find it [here](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/genouest/events).

Upcoming (and past) events with content relevant to the GenOuest Galaxy community. For events prior to this year, see the [events archive](/genouest/events/archive/).
