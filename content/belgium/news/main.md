## VIB Galaxy News is still migrating

This page won't have all historical posts until we're done moving content from the old host.

This is the home for new posts about ELIXIR-Belgium's Galaxy server, but if you're looking for older content, you can find it [here](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/belgium/news).

This page contains announcements of interest to the Galaxy Community. These
include __items from the Galaxy Team or the Galaxy community__ and address
anything that is of wide interest to the community.

Also see the *[Galactic Blog](/blog/)* for more.

### Contribute

To add a news item, create a new folder within the [_news folder_](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/tree/master/content/news) with an _index.md_ file. It's probably easiest to copy the format from one of the other existing news items as a template.
