# Galaxy Technical Board (GTB)

The [GTB](/community/governance/gtb/) is a governance structure representing [Galaxy Working Groups](/community/wg/) (WGs) that manage
different aspects of the Galaxy Ecosystem.
The Galaxy Working Groups and the [GTB](/community/governance/gtb/) are focussed on technical development, manage important project infrastructure assets,
including source code. WGs are self-organised, and nominate a representative, which serves on the [GTB](/community/governance/gtb/).
The [GTB](/community/governance/gtb/) contributes to the roadmap, especially by providing technical input.
