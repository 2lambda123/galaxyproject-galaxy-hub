The Galaxy community gathers in the Community Calls to share updates and discussions. And the most important part: everyone is welcome to present in this new forum!

## When?

**Every other Thursday at 3 pm UTC**.

## How will they work?

The call will be divided in two parts: 
- First part: **presentation** about a topic of interest, followed by questions and discussion.
- Second part: **general community updates**. We will keep a running document with agendas that you can look up or edit anytime.

Every call will be chaired by a community member that will:
- Introduce the speaker;
- Moderate the Q&A after the talk;
- Walk the attendees through the agenda on the second part of the call, with inputs from other community members;
- Encourage the attendees to take collaborative notes.


## But wait... can I present?

Sure, you can! These calls are open to any topics of interest related to the Galaxy community. A few **ideas**:
- You've made a new, cool contribution to the Galaxy ecosystem that others should know about (Galaxy feature, tool, workflow, etc.);
- You are trying to launch your own community within Galaxy and are seeking help or advice, or want to share your progress with others;
- You'd like to explore possible collaborations with the Galaxy community members;
- You are working on an interesting scientific project;
- You want to introduce your local community to the global community;
- You have finished a mentorship program and want to talk about your project;
- ... or whatever you consider that is worth sharing!

Please [get in touch](mailto:outreach@galaxyproject.org) if you'd like to present.
