## General information


- **Contract**: TV-L 13, full-time, 3 years
- **Location**: Freiburg, Germany
- **Closing date**: January 2023, 9th
- **Position start**: After March 2023, 1st
- **Contact**: Bérénice Batut, Björn Grüning

Are you passionate about training in life sciences? The Freiburg Galaxy Team is looking for a team member who will **develop, coordinate and implement training programs within international communities**, especially via BioNT, a new multi-organization project funded by the European Commission, and via the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) (GTN).

Within the University of Freiburg and the [Bioinformatics Group Freiburg](http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de) (headed by Prof. Dr. Rolf Backofen), the [Freiburg Galaxy Team](/freiburg/) is led by Björn Grüning and is part of [ELIXIR Germany](https://www.denbi.de/elixir-de). The team develops and offers several services to enable **reproducible** and **accessible** research for everyone. The flagship service is the European Galaxy server [UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/), with 50,000+ users who have access to an open-access computational infrastructure through Galaxy as a gateway for data resources, tools, and applications for **FAIR** data analysis. The team is also deeply involved in **training and capacity building**, e.g. in data analysis, programming, data management, and Galaxy server administration. The Freiburg Galaxy Team is very active in the community-driven development and maintenance of [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) (GTN) material, the [Street Science Community](https://streetscience.community/), and also in the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) program. The team is also strongly connected with international training communities such as the [ELIXIR Training platform](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/training), [GOBLET](https://www.mygoblet.org/), and [Life Science Trainers](https://lifescitrainers.org/).

The BioNT (Bio Network for Training) project is a **consortium of 10 partners** from Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and Norway and is led by EMBL Heidelberg. It aims at **increasing computational literacy and capacity** by providing short training courses to a diverse audience, from job-seekers to managers of companies, active in biotechnology, bio-data, and software development across the Life Sciences. The initiative will provide a unique opportunity for **interaction between academic and industrial stakeholders**, in particular with excellent training providers from both sectors. The project structure is inspired by The Carpentries and close interactions are anticipated.

## Your role

The successful candidate will work as part of the Freiburg Galaxy team in the Bioinformatics Group Freiburg and with stakeholders across the BioNT consortium and the GTN. You will:
