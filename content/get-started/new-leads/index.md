title: Set up your own community

<div class='right'><img src="/images/undraw-illustrations/mind_map.svg" alt="" width="240" /></div>

There are already many existing professional groups within the Galaxy project. The members of these groups are organized according to: 

- their [**topics of interest**](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/), these groups are called **Working Groups** and are in charge of the entire galaxy ecosystem such as code development & maintenance, user interface, etc.
- their [**region**](/community/#regional-communities) - these are communities which belong to a particular geographical region in the world, e.g. France, Australia, etc.
- their [**domain of science**](/community/#communities-of-practice) - these are _communities of practice_ in different scientific domains

The _communities of practice_ are usually referred to as [Special Interest Groups](/community/sig/) (SIG) and are focused on a specific research domain. If you are involved in a particular research topic and want to learn from other colleagues and share your activities with them, **Special Interest Groups** are what you are looking for.

We encourage you to look through the existing [Special Interest Groups](/community/sig/) and find the one which is appropriate for your needs. You can always join an existing SIG and contribute to that community. However, if you don't find a SIG that fits your work, domain or region, or you don't feel identified with any of them, you can create your own community of practice SIG! 

You are still wondering if and why you should start a new SIG? Find some arguments [here](/community/governance/gcb/#why-make-a-sig)!

### What is _good to know_ before you start building a SIG

The goal of building a new community is to establish a working environment related to your domain of expertise. In the  process of creating and maintaining a SIG, regardless of your research domain, you will need to address the following issues:

1. Identify the technical challenges you want to handle. They will be the main focus for your SIG and will determine the major part of its activities. Here is a very _inexhaustive_ list of potential requirements you may want to meet:
   
    * create relevant tools and software
    * define and manage special data formats
    * manage big data (specific to your domain?)
    * share and reproduce the processes and the results of your work
    * obtain the optimal computational resources for achieving your goals

2. Administer your group
    
    * Set up means of communication (mailing lists, chat channels)
    * Set up a group organization and nominate members responsible for SIG's routines (contact person, tool support person, etc.)
      
3. Publish your results and promote your experience in order to: 

    * extend and share the acquired expertise
    * attract new people into your SIG by identifying other groups who might benefit from your experience

4. Organise a training process for all interested in your SIG activites
    
    * set up a [training network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) for your domain
    * maintain a training documentation (slides, hands-on, automation routines)

### What is _good to do_ before you start building a SIG

#### Learn the basics about Galaxy

First of all, you should start with our dedicated [**Get Started**](https://galaxyproject.org/get-started/) page to get a head-start of what Galaxy is about.
You'll find all the necessary resources and you could even participate in the [**Galaxy Mentorship Network**](https://galaxy-mentor-network.netlify.app/)
to get started with the help of a Galaxy Mentor.

#### Get acquainted with the Galaxy Training Network

The Galaxy Training Network ([GTN](https://training.galaxyproject.org)) is collection of tutorials developed and maintained by the worldwide Galaxy community. 
It will show you how various SIGs, e.g. **Climate**, **Metabolomics**, carry out their work, prepare training materials and organize their events

#### Learn about Tool Development
Galaxy has many tools already installed and ready to be used but when creating your community, you'll probably need specific tools for your Galaxy analysis. Don't worry, see our dedicated page for [**Tool Authors**](/tools/) where you'll find everything you'll need and also reach out to the [**Tools Working Group**](/community/wg/) via Gitter.

Don't forget to follow the [**Best Practices**](https://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices.html) for writing [**Galaxy Tools**](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/).

#### Get involved
- Introduce yourself and dive in our [Special Interest Groups](/community/sig/)
- Participate in our [worldwide Galaxy Events](/events/)

###  Some useful recomendations

<div class='right'><img src="/images/undraw-illustrations/questions.svg" alt="" width="180" /></div>

| __DO__ | __DON'T__  |
|---|---|
| Be patient! Take the time to learn the basics about Galaxy. | Hurry and dive in straight  to create without knowing a lot about Galaxy and its workarounds. |
| Join the Galaxy [Matrix channel](https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/matrix-for-im/) and consult the [Galaxy help pages](https://help.galaxyproject.org/) | Spend hours or days to read and debug the galaxy code |
| Ask if a tool you need already exists before starting to develop one. | Get hazy with all your tool's possible needs as there are many installed already that can be close to what you would like.|
| Request your tool to be reviewed, avoid managing your repo alone! | Be a lone wolf. The main servers may not want to install your tool as they want to make sure it follows the [**standards**](https://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices.html) they have defined for developing tools. |
| When you happen to need a tool: Make the tool -> write the training -> set up an event. Repeat events and take advantage of Galaxyâ€™s infrastructure [Smorgasbord](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord3/) , [CoFests](https://galaxyproject.org/events/cofests/), [GCC](https://galaxyproject.org/gcc/), etc. to improve your tool, maximize its use and receive feedback from the community. | Set to create very specific tools and avoid feedback. |
| Use already established servers. Asking for a subdomain within the [**usegalaxy.eu**](https://usegalaxy.eu/) server is a great option! |Set up a server all by yourself (consider resources, complexity, security issues and more).|
