# Welcome!

<span style="font-size:medium;">This page will be your starting point for Galaxy, the go-to place when you need to refresh your knowledge once you have already get to know more about the Community.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">Below you will find a __step-by-step suggested pathway__ for you to follow as a newcomer, a student, an expert or just about anybody interested in using Galaxy.</span>

## Step 1: Get acquainted with Galaxy terminology

The [__Galaxy Glossary__ <i class="fa fa-solid fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i>](/get-started/glossary/)  contains the terminology, acronyms and definitions. As a newbie, you will probably skim through this list, but later on in your journey you may come back to refer to it as it will help you get a better understanding of the Galaxy Ecosystem. 

## Step 2 : Get familiar with Galaxy

### Public Servers

The easiest way to be able to follow our tutorials and learn first-hand about Galaxy is by using a[ __Public Galaxy Server__](/use/). We recommend using one of these :
- [**US Server**](https://usegalaxy.org)
- [**EU Server**](https://usegalaxy.eu/)  
- [**AU Server**](https://usegalaxy.org.au/)

We also encourage you to create an account for the server you'll be using to keep track of your histories and workflows.

### Tutorials and tours
This curated table will take you through the basics of Galaxy. You can choose any tutorial in a variety of formats: **Hands-on** and **Slides** tutorials are more text-based while **Recording** and **Interactive Tour** are more visual-based.
