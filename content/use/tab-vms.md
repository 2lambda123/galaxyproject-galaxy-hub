title: Virtual Machines (VMs)
---

VMs are similar to containers but use a different technology. Containers take significant advantage of your computer's underlying operating system. Virtual Machines include an entire supporting operating system, and are significantly larger than containers. You run these locally by first installing a VM player like VirtualBox, and then downloading and launching the VM within that player. These use local resources.
