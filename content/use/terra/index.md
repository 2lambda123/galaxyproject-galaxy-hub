comments:
- "Terra is a scalable and secure platform for biomedical researchers to access data, run analysis tools and collaborate. Terra enables researchers to run familiar bioinformatics platforms, such as Galaxy and Bioconductor in RStudio on commercial cloud platforms such as Google Compute and Microsoft Azure.  Terra insulates the user from the details of installing software (e.g, Galaxy and RStudio) and the intricacies of deploying that software on the cloud."
- "Terra is used in several large projects, including NHGRI's [AnVIL Project](https://anvilproject.org/), which makes [Galaxy accessible](/use/anvil/) in a secure, FISMA-Moderate environment where researchers can perform analysis on personally identifiable data."
- "Each researcher (or group) launches their own instance of Galaxy, running within Terra."

quotas:
- "Terra is classified as both an *academic cloud* and a *commercial cloud* platform.  It is definitely a *research cloud* platform, but it is built on *commercial clouds* and **is a pay-per-use platform**.  As a cloud platform you control how many resources are allocated to your Galaxy instance."
