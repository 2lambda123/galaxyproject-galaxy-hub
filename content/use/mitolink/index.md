comments:
- "Provides a complete pipeline based system to analyse and visualize the role of SNPs in Mitochondrial Diseases."
- "It also provides an in-house mitochondrial protein repository which allows to elucidate the role of the both mitochondrial and nuclear genome in mitochondrial dysfunction."
- "Integrated data from the GenomeAsia Pilot Project, gnomAD, DisGenNET and ClinVar to understand impact of genomic variation through gene-disease networks."
