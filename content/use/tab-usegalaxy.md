[UseGalaxy servers](/usegalaxy/) implement a common core set of tools and reference genomes, and are open to anyone to use.  They also contain tools and genomes that are local to each server. Each is backed by significant computational resources and they are excellent places to get started with Galaxy, and to share and publish your results.
