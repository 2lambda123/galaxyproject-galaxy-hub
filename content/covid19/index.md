title: "Global platform for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data: Genomics, Cheminformatics, and Proteomics"
description: "Using open source tools and public cyberinfrastructure for transparent, reproducible analyses of viral datasets."
components: true

The goal of this resource is to provide publicly accessible infrastructure
and workflows for SARS-CoV-2 data analyses. We currently feature three
different types of analyses: [Genomics](#genomics), [Cheminformatics](#cheminformatics), and [Proteomics](#proteomics).

import Monitoring from "~/components/Monitoring.vue";
import HomeFeatures from "~/components/HomeFeatures.vue";

<Monitoring />
<HomeFeatures />

The analyses have been performed using the [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org) platform and open source tools from [BioConda](https://bioconda.github.io/). Tools were run using [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) resources maintained by the Texas Advanced Computing Center ([TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/)),
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center ([PSC](https://www.psc.edu/)), and [Indiana University](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) in the U.S., [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/), [VSC](https://www.vscentrum.be) cloud resources and [IFB](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/en/cluster) cluster resources on the European side, [STFC-IRIS](https://stfc.ukri.org/) at the Diamond Light Source, and [ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au) cloud resources in Australia.
