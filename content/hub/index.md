title: About The Galaxy Community Hub
---

This website ([galaxyproject.org](/)) is a central place for information and updates about the Galaxy Project.

The Hub is a [static site](https://bejamas.io/discovery/static-site-generators/) which uses a static site generator named [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) to generate HTML files from Markdown files. What this means for authors is that you download the source files from the [Github repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub), write your page in a new Markdown file (or edit an existing one), then submit it as a pull request on Github. You can also do all of this in your browser on Github, if that's easier.

For tips on formatting your pages in Markdown, see [here](/hub/authoring/).
