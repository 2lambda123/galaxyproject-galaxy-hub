This page keeps track of some institutional knowledge about this site (the Galaxy Community Hub) itself.

Gridsome version
----------------

This is the [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) rewrite of the Hub.

This went live on 13 Sep 2021: [PR #772](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/pull/772) (commit [6d7ee41](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/commit/6d7ee41062cbdca52588dd35fc3a3983575f8443)) merged the branch with the Gridsome code (commit [4592c7a](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/commit/4592c7a28a953d82a2cea227dbe8d71ebbadab78)) with the Metalsmith site (commit [9807ac1](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/commit/9807ac1bf8880fc7fac20b1809774796d0305cc2)). The last Metalsmith version is tagged [`hub1`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/releases/tag/hub1).

The next big step was the launch of the "Global Hub" on 30 Sep 2022 ([PR #1651](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/pull/1651)).


Metalsmith version
------------------

This was the first version powered by a static site generator ([Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io)).

The content was seeded by scraping the Moin Moin version (not without some [errors](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/issues/690)).

Wiki version
------------

This version was a wiki powered by [MoinMoin](https://moinmo.in).
