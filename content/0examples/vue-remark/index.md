This also serves to provide a page with all the metadata fields present. If you have a dynamic page with a GraphQL query for a metadata field, there must be at least one page with that field present. Otherwise Gridsome throws an error.

Normally `category` isn't present in the metadata. It's autopopulated by the framework based on where the Markdown file is placed. But this isn't placed in a category, so it's in the metadata here as a workaround.

## Inserts

Here's how Inserts are inserted:

<slot name="/0examples/footer" />

## Vue components

Using Vue components:

import Continent from '~/components/Continent.vue'

They can even be used <continent continent="EU" /> inline!

## Graymatter

Using metadata fields in the content:

Authors: {{ $frontmatter.authors }}
