# Short HOW-TOs on analysis of bacterial and viral data

-----

SARS-CoV-2 pandemic showed that even elementary analyses of sequence data can be daunting for many researchers due to the lack of access to tools, infrastructure and expertise. Here you will find examples of common research questions and a point-by-point explanation of how they can answered using Galaxy.

Here we will use Monkeypox as an example to show its relationship with previously identified sequences. We will find all related Monkeypox sequences, understand how distant they are from our sequence, and create a list of common variants. |
