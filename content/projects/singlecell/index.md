We are a mix of users, developers, and trainers providing feedback and energy to improve and expand the Galaxy single cell capabilities. Do you use Galaxy single cell tools for scRNA-seq or beyond? Do you have feedback for us? Want to be a tester of new resources? Want to impact the future of single cell in Galaxy? Are you a developer looking for a place to play? Are you developing Galaxy single cell materials and want to stay aware of what others are doing in this field?

**Welcome to the Galaxy Single-Cell Community of Practice!**

## I'm just trying to learn to analyse my data, how did I get here?
Hello user! You'll be interested in the following resources:

 - [Learning pathway for getting to grips with Galaxy and single cell](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/learning-pathways/intro_single_cell.html)
 - [Single cell training material](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/)
 - Galaxy instance: [Single cell instance](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu) or Human Cell Atlas instance](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu)
 - [Matrix channel for asking for help](https://matrix.to/#/#Galaxy-Training-Network_galaxy-single-cell:gitter.im)

Saying that, we'd absolutely love to have users feedback on their experiences to help us improve. You'd be very welcome to join the Community of Practice to help improve the Galaxy single cell space!

# What are the goals of the single cell community of practice?

üéØGoals
- Prevent work duplication
- Collaborate across pipeline, ensuring users feedback to developers
- Identify community needs
- Tool & tutorial development
- Testing
- Build & support user community
- Benchmarking tools and workflows

# Who are we looking for?

Anyone with energy! We love hearing from users, developers, trainers, and everyone in between who is using or developing Galaxy for single cell analysis.

# How do we function?

**Meetings** We meet every 6 weeks (alternating USA and AU time zones) for 1 hour.

Our meeting agenda is:
 - Random intro chatter & introductions
 - Updates from Trello site (what people are working on / asking for help)
    - üêõHelp/bugs
    - Status reports & new stuff that‚Äôs happening
 - Other cool stuff (example: Smorgasbord)
 - Ongoing actions to send out

**Emails** We send out emails to the mailing list after each meeting, at the mid-way point between meetings, and the day before meetings as a reminder.

**Notes** We keep rolling notes on a googledoc and monitor our work on Trello.

**Collaborative Chat Forums** When people ask for help or are working across institutes, we set up chat sub-channels to bring them together.

**General Chat Forum** We have a chat forum to discuss news and ideas, and are represented in the Galaxy Community Reps chat group.
