## Expected Results

Pulsar Network: A mature and tested (TRL-9) distributed compute network with demonstrated usage across at least 12 European partners.

ScienceGateways: 6 national Galaxy instances operational and proven by the scientific community with more than 100,000 users.

Communities: Science Gateway with a custom set of tools and workflows for the Biodiversity/Climate, Materials Science and Astrophysics community.

FAIR data: EOSC-catalogued FAIR data and workflows that can be found, consumed, created and published by users of the EuroScienceGateway, demonstrated for each of the 3 domain-specific use-cases.

## Target Groups

European Scientists (direct): Access to tools, workflows, storage and compute resources will enable breakthrough research across disciplines.

Users of public data (direct): This project will facilitate making high quality, validated FAIR data and workflows, which is crucial for re-use by the scientific community.

EOSC (direct): EuroScienceGateway will contribute to the adoption of e.g. e-Infrastructures and FAIR publishing services of EOSC across domains, lowering the barrier for cross-disciplinary research. This project will increase the use and adoption of EOSC endorsed principles, standards and technologies, as defined by the research infrastructures and various EOSC-related projects.

Education system (indirect): The open and accessible EuroScienceGateway can be used to train and educate students and citizens. The ecosystem provides both specific tools and resources for training, as well as the ability to use the exact same system to perform research at scale.

European funding agencies (indirect): Computing resources are used more efficiently, duplication of effort to port existing methodologies due to infrastructure limitations will be avoided and re-use of resources and technologies across scientific domains will be stimulated.

## Outcomes

Communities: Onboarding of new scientific communities in the EuroScienceGateway ecosystem, demonstrated by new users and increased usage per user, and contribution of new tools, workflows and resources to the EuroScienceGateway. Inclusion of the established network in proposals for innovative research projects of multiple disciplines as well as EOSC-related infrastructure oriented and trans-national access to research infrastructure projects.

Scientific: Transform the way scientists create, share and exploit data and metadata (like workflows) resulting in higher quality research and more innovation.

Resource providers: Implementation of the middleware developed in this project by resource providers not part of the consortium.

Global: Alignment with similar American and Asia-Pacific initiatives. Building a global network of shared resources for all scientists.

## Impacts

Scientific: The EuroScienceGateway is envisioned as an enabler of breakthrough scientific discoveries in various scientific fields.

EOSC: Increased visibility of the European Science Cloud to end-users. Economic/Technological: Adoption and efficient usage of resources provided by the e-Infrastructures. Scaling of data analyses will be facilitated e.g. by eliminating the steep learning curve to use new computational infrastructure unfamiliar to the researchers. Societal: Raised awareness of public academic resources/clouds and contribute to the practical implementation of FAIR principles for data, software and workflows.
