Supporting analysis of MPXV viruses

- We have three workflows for analysis of Illumina data (Oxford nanopore workflows can also be added. Request here).
- Workflows can be used to analyze any number of samples.
- Workflows can be used via graphical user interface right now on any of our public instances in EU (https://usegalaxy.eu), US (https://usegalaxy.org), or Australia (https://usegalaxy.org.au).
- We provide powerful computational infrastructure for data analysis supported by national supercomputing resources in the US, EU, and Australia.
