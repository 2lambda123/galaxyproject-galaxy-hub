<!-- Width calculations: Normally make this section take up the remaining space to the left of the image (100%-430px), but when the screen gets small, the image will shrink to 50% of the width, so this section can take the other half. -->
<div class="left" style="width: calc(100% - 430px); min-width: calc(50% - 20px); margin-right: 10px">

We regularly provide workshops.

But we cannot always meet capacity, so we've put all of our training materials online. This has become a community project with people from all over the world contributing training materials.

Topics include: variant analysis, transcriptomics, metagenomics, epigenetics, and many more!
