title: Galaxy on the NSF Jetstream cloud
---

The Galaxy project is making use of the [NSF Jetstream
cloud](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) predominantly to support scalable
operations of usegalaxy.org server. Use of this resource is transparent to the
user as a set of jobs submitted are automatically routed to Jetstream resources.
Which jobs are routed to Jetstream depends on the resource requirements of a
tool. Meanwhile, the size of resources available for users jobs is dynamically
scaled to accommodate current workloads.

On average jobs from about 1,000 users from usegalaxy.org are automatically sent
to the Jetstream cloud each month, ranging between 5,000 and 7,000 jobs.
