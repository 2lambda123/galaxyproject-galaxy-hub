title: Galaxy and the Cloud
---

**The Galaxy project makes opportunistic use of cloud computing to offer multiple
services suitable for different use cases. This page outlines the available
options, summarizing the most suitable option for a given use case.**

## Managed Galaxy servers, ready to use
Usegalaxy.* is a world-wide federation of managed Galaxy servers that are free
and ready to use. These are shared resources that provide a generous allocation
of compute and storage resources along with hundreds of tools and reference
genomes. Learning and performing analysis of non-private or non-protected
datasets are the perfect use cases for these services. These servers make use of
various cloud providers (e.g., [NSF Jetstream](jetstream)) to accommodate large workloads.

## Dedicated Galaxy instances, including use with protected datasets
[AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/) is a cloud-based platform where anyone can
get access to Galaxy as well as direct access to a plethora of datasets. Currently,
there is about 4PB of human data available in AnVIL that are linked directly
into Galaxy. The AnVIL platform carries the [US FedRamp
certification](https://www.fedramp.gov/), which means protected and private
datasets can be uploaded and analyzed on this resource.

## Infrastructure for training events
If you are an instructor or a trainer delivering workshops and would like an
experience that offers responsive job execution directly on usegalaxy.org or
usegalaxy.eu servers, there is Training Infrastructure as a Service, or TIaaS.
With TIaaS trainers can register that they wish to have a training event,
administrators can approve the request and allocate capacity to that training
event. During an event, participants join a training group via a URL and receive
priority for job execution, ensuring that training events run smoothly and are
not affected by significant server load or power users running their analyses.
