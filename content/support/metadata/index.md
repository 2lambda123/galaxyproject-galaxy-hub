# When and how are metadata assigned?

* During **Upload** on new datasets, either autodetected (default) or directly assigned by the user
* With the **Edit Attributes functions** on existing datasets, either autodetected or directly assigned by the user
* By **upstream tools** based on the those tool's input metadata assignments (inherited) or as new defined outputs types

# Changing or updating dataset metadata

Click on the the dataset's pencil icon to reach the _Edit Attributes_ forms in the center panel to change or update metadata. Metadata attributes can include: database (dbkey, genome, transcriptome, custom genome), datatype (including compression format, e.g. gzipped versus not), column assignments (chrom, start, end, and more), row assignments (specify comments lines), permissions, and others.
