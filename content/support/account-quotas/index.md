## How account quotas work

Each Galaxy server is independent. How much disk space to allocate for end users is determined by the administrators of that server.

If you are working at [Galaxy Main](/main/) (https://usegalaxy.org), each registered account is granted 250 GB of quota space (disk usage for data storage). Review full details [here (account and job quotas)](/main/#user-data-and-job-quotas) and [here (account terms)](/support/account/).

Should you have questions after reviewing the options below, this is how to get help:

* Review prior Q`&`A or ask a novel question at the **Galaxy Help** forum https://help.galaxyproject.org/.
* Chat with us at **Gitter** https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby/.
* Send an **email** to [galaxy-bugs@lists.galaxyproject.org](mailto:galaxy-bugs@lists.galaxyproject.org) from your registered account email address.
* **All options** [https://galaxyproject.org/support/#help-resources](/support/#help-resources).

Working at a different Public Galaxy server? If you question is general, try the Galaxy Help forum. If server specific or account related, that server's home page or directory page usually contains contact and other information concerning account terms, questions, issues, and quota policies: [Galaxy Platform Directory](/use/). If you cannot find the contact information, or are not sure about what the problem is exactly, ask for advice at the Galaxy Help forum or at Gitter. The more context you provide (server URL, problem details), the quicker our community will be able to assist you.


## [Does your account usage quota seem incorrect?](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/user_preferences_account_usage_quota.html)

## How to log in or out of Galaxy?

The options are included under the **User** menu in the top masthead.

## I need more space for my work

If the account usage is showing that quota is exceeded -[over 250 GB](/main/):

### [Find all Histories and *purge* (aka permanently delete) those not needed](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_find_purge.html)


### [Find all Datasets or just review those in the active history and *purge* (aka permanently delete) those not needed](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/datasets_purging_datasets.html)

### Find Histories that have been shared with you, and unshare those not needed

To know more about unsharing unwanted histories, follow [this FAQ](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_unsharing_histories.html). 

### [Reduce quota usage while still retaining prior work (data, tools, methods)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/reduce_quota_usage.html)


## Use-cases for managing data

Have a very large history that is difficult to mange? Review the options below for some tips.

* Navigate to a history (**User > Histories**) and use the history menu function "Purge Deleted Datasets". That will make sure that any datasets that were only *deleted* become *permanently deleted (purged)*. Note that *purged* data cannot be recovered, even by an administer.
* Navigate to a history (**User > Histories**) and use the history menu function *Copy Datasets*. Only active datasets will appear in the middle panel view listing of datasets. Select the datasets that you wish to retain and copy those into a new history. Once completed, go back and permanently delete (purge) the entire original history under **User > Histories**. You may need to log out then back into Galaxy again to reset the quota usage.
* If you copy a *dataset collection* to a new or different history, the *hidden* datasets associated with that collection are also copied.
* Copies of datasets within your own account do not individually count against quota usage -- these are "clones" unless a change is made (after a change, copies do become distinct datasets and count toward quota usage individually). If you change a copied dataset, consider updating/removing the original tag(s), or add more tag(s).
* Keep future histories smaller by breaking up analysis into different histories. You can always keep copies (aka "clones") of important or frequently reused datasets datasets in different histories. Examples include: reference annotation, custom fasta genomes/transcriptomes/exomes, processed results, original source read data (pre or post QA/QC).
* Sometimes it is helpful to add tags to datasets that are important or frequently reused to better keep track of datasets that represent the same original data in different histories. Tag the original dataset or dataset collection (#name-of-tag) and any copies will inherit that same tag when copied.
* Consider creating a dedicated history for important or frequently reused datasets. You can create a copy of that entire history to a new history, give it a meaningful name, then start a new analysis.
* Histories can also have tags added to help you keep analysis/data organized.
* To review all of your histories, go to **User > Histories**. Note that if you have many histories, that view may take some time to load. Be patient, it will load, and when you reload that view again within a short time period, the view will load/resolve quicker. The listing includes the history name, dataset state summaries, overall size of *active* + *hidden* + *deleted* datasets, associated history tags, sharing status, and the history state. Only *active* histories are shown by default. Use the *Advanced Search* function to review all histories with different states (*active*, *deleted*, *permanently deleted aka purged*). Only purged datasets and histories do not count toward quota usage.
* To review all of your datasets, go to **User > Datasets**. Note that if you have many datasets, then that view may take some time to load. Be patient, it will load, and when you reload that view again within a short time period, the view will load/resolve quicker. The listing includes the dataset name, associated tags, the datatype, and when the data was last updated. The view can be sorted by any of those attributes. You can also search and copy datasets from that view, plus navigate to the history where a dataset is located. Note: Only *active* datasets are displayed on that view -- *hidden*, *deleted*, and *purged* datasets are not listed and dataset cannot have the state changed. You must manage a dataset state from within the history containing the dataset.

## I purged but still need more space!

Account quotas are generally fixed at 250 Gb for [Galaxy Main](/main/). Other Galaxy servers may differ for quota size and policy. For very large projects, consider moving to a local or cloud Galaxy where you can control the resources.

*Important*: Increased working space (quota size) is unrelated to the computational resouces used to process analysis jobs. If your jobs are failing because they are exceeding resources, there is either an input/usage problem or the work is actually too large to process at the server. Not sure? Check here: [My job ended with an error. What can I do?](/support/tool-error/).

* Some work is simply too large for the public resource. How to know? Review the [Using Galaxy choices explained here](/use/#which-platform-platform-type-to-choose) and the [Webinar: Use Galaxy on the web, the cloud, and your laptop too](/events/2020-12-webinar-where/).
* If your work is academic research based and additional short-term space is needed at Galaxy Main (https://usegalaxy.org), please send an email to galaxy-bugs@lists.galaxyproject.org from your registered account email address, briefly explaining your project and we may be able to help.
* Also include this information in your email or we will request it, delaying action: 1) your primary academic email address 2) how much space you need 3) how long you need the extra space.
* Double-check that you are actually purging old work correctly. We will check first before granting any extra quota.
* **Note**: If you have registered or are using or have used more than one account at the Galaxy Main server, this violates our [Terms of Usage](https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html). Account terms are explained in a simple and specific sentence exactly where you clicked on the activation link in the registration email received when the account was first opened. If that was not clear enough, you must *proactively* clear up account issues and get down to and *keep using* just one account *before extra quota can be granted*. Yes, we will check when you ask, and deny requests that are incomplete. Duplicated accounts created/detected after extra quota is granted will result in the loss of all associated accounts and data, without another reminder.
* Not sure what to do? If you have more than one account (old or new) at UseGalaxy.org, manage the data yourself and delete extra/old accounts under *User > Preferences*. Review here if terms of usage are not clear and email us to sort things out if you need to: [Getting an account at Galaxy Main (https://usegalaxy.org)](/support/account/)
* Other Public Galaxy server's may have different account terms or quota increase request proccesses. Check the server's home page or the server's directory page here to locate contact and other information concerning account terms, questions, issues, and quota policies: [Galaxy Platform Directory](/use/)
