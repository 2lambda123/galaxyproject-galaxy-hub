## Datatypes and Tools

### Help! The tool I'm using doesn't recognize any input datasets

This is usually a simple datatype assignment incompatibility between the [dataset](/learn/managing-datasets/) and the tool.

Expected input [datatype](/learn/datatypes/) format is explained on the Tool form itself within the parameter settings and help text.

### How to fix

_**Convert Format**_ or modify the datatype using the dataset's ![pencil](/images/icons/pencil.png "pencil") icon to reach the _**Edit Attributes**_ form.

Many attributes can be edited on these forms, including **datatype**, **database**, and other **metadata**.

You may need to first create a **[Custom Build](/learn/custom-genomes/) and assign that as a database** when using a *Custom Reference Genome*.
