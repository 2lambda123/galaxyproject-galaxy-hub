# **Researchers** | Don’t pay for data analytics support: It already exists and it is free

-----

- **Thousands of tools**: Already installed and configured
- **Best analysis practices**: Perform entire analyses end-to-end
- **Power and scalability**: Analyze just a few or thousands of samples
- **Powerful user interface**: Analyze data in your web-browser
- **Interactive analyses when you need them**: Use tools such as Jupyter from Galaxy IU
- **Hardware included**: Enough storage and computation for most experimental designs
- **Interactive documentation**: Tutorials for most popular analysis scenarios 

# **Data Analysts** | Concentrate on what matters: Don’t deal with plumbing

-----

- **Use existing powerful infrastructure**: Automate workflow execution with Galaxy API
- **Optimize hardware use:** Distribute analyses to appropriate resources 
- **Leverage your own infrastructure**: Take advantage of your own hardware if needed
- **Don’t worry about dependencies**: Let Conda and BioContainers do the work for you
- **Be resource-agnostic**: Run analysis locally, in the cloud, or on powerful public infrastructure
- **Let your colleagues run their analysis:** Create workflows that can be used by researchers immediately
- **Automate**: Run complex workflows against our infrastructure via API

# **Students** | Learn best practices and understand science

------

- **Impress your PI**: Perform complex analyses quickly without asking for resources 
- **Choose from hundreds of “how-to” tutorials**: ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Assembly, Variant calling, Climate Analysis, Computation Chemistry, Imaging, Proteomics, Metagenomics, you name it
- **Understand what is happening**: Our tutorials not only explain how to do it, they explain why it is done this way 
- **Go beyond standard tools:** Grow your analysis skills with interactive tools such as Jupyter and RStudio 

# **Instructors** | Run workshops or semester-long classes

----

- **Tutorials + Infrastructure**: All your students need is a web---browser—hardware is included
- **Choose from hundreds of “how-to” tutorials**: ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Assembly, Variant calling, Climate Analysis, Computation Chemistry, Imaging, Proteomics, Metagenomics, you name it
- **Keep an eye on your students**: Identify those who need help with a unified dashboard

# **Developers** | Get your tools used by those who need them most

-----

- Massive user base: Hundreds of thousands of users across US, EU, and AU instances
- A fully featured SDK: Planemo framework for developing, testing and deployment. 
- IDE integration: Rapid onboarding and fast development with Galaxy Language Server
- A main component of global open source ecosystem: We are a part of BioConda and BioContainer
- Community support: Help and guidance from hundreds of developers

<!--

For PIs

Don’t reinvent the wheel: The best analysis practices for your data likely exists in Galaxy already 
Don’t pay for support and infrastructure: Galaxy provides both
