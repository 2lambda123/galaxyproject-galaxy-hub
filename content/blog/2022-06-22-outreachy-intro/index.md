In June 2022, we welcomed 3 Outreachy interns: Melke Berhan, Shivani Sangwan and Soumya Jha. 

## What is Outreachy and why we care about it?

This is the 2nd time the Galaxy Community is contributing to Outreachy so you may not be very familiar with this program yet.

Outreachy Internship Program offers 3 month long paid internships to people who are underrepresented in free and open source projects.

And this is why we care: we believe we need to increase the diversity of contributors to Galaxy and that we need to be proactive to make it happen.

## 3 interns and 3 projects

This round we offered 3 different projects:

- Galaxy-dev;
- Galaxy-climate;
- Galaxy wellbeing and mental health.

Below each intern is being presented and give their expectation on working on Galaxy outreachy projects.
