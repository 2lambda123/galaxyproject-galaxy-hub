Have you heard about the **Climate Science Workbench** of Galaxy? It is named **GALAXY CLIMATE**. This is the first blog in the series of five blogs that I will be sharing. Let’s explore it in more detail.
Aiming to make computational data analysis accessible to research scientists (from those who lack knowledge in computer programming or systems administration to the most advanced users), Galaxy is a platform for scientific workflow, data integration, analysis, persistence, and publishing. Despite being primarily domain-independent and used as a general workflow management system, it was initially created for genomics research. In recent times, Galaxy has initiated the inclusion and development of Climate-related tools under its toolshed.

Galaxy Climate is a scientific workbench focusing on making climate analysis easier, in simpler words - “ **command-line free**.” It houses numerous tools, which makes the process a lot more convenient. The number of tools available for the purpose is rich and is increasing with demand.The robust community which makes it possible is efficiently equipped with the requisite expertise and passion for the initiative.


# WHY IS THE GALAXY FOCUSING ON CLIMATE SCIENCE?

We live on Earth, but why? To state, it has the right temperature, air, and water conditions for our survival. It is an inevitable fact that climate is associated with our existence. And both go hand-in-hand. Technological advances can be of actual use if we can ensure our survival. The world is shifting to greener norms or a more sustainable tomorrow.

Handling massive command-line-focused analysis of climate data can be exhaustive as well as cumbersome. Sometimes it may be system environments, and other times, it may be some technical jargon that has the probability of delaying the analysis. And not everyone is well equipped with coding skills. Nevertheless, a standard, easy-to-use, accurate, and scientifically sound platform is the need of the hour. The GALAXY CLIMATE has almost met all the criteria for improving the situation. And is still growing.



# WHAT ARE THE EXISTING CLIMATE TOOLS IN THE GALAXY TOOLSHED?

The Galaxy tool shed houses more than 2000 tools, out of which several tools are helpful for Climate Analysis.  Some of the relevant tags to find under the Galaxy Toolshed are: “Climate Analysis”, “Ecology”, etc. Follow the list given below for more clarity.

# WHAT NEXT?


Climate data vary from other generic data in various ways. Its dimensions are generally huge and are mainly available in netCDF, binary, etc. formats, requiring new and more straightforward tools to work on. We have tools for tabular and comma-separated values (CSV) designs, but few instruments are targeted toward netCDF file analysis. Some available tools can be found here [xarray_coords_info](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository/browse_repository?id=0535bc9a272a7dba). Besides these, there are a couple of other tools.
Although the ocean of existing tools can be used in combinations to obtain the desired results, this will again create the issue of complicated /untidy workflows and confusion. Moreover, a [newcomer](https://galaxyproject.org/get-started/) to the Galaxy Climate instance may hesitate to learn the jargon and get stuck. Nevertheless, the vision toward expanding climate-specific tools is being highly propagated. The process of tool contribution is not very tedious, and anyone who wishes to do so can contribute.


# WHAT AM I DOING?


As an Outreachy Intern, I will focus on analyzing the climate of the financial capital Of India, the city of Mumbai, ((lat: 18.75,19.25; lon:72.50, 73.00)). Being situated at the coast of the Arabian Sea, the city of Mumbai is experiencing critical climate events which have led the [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/chapter-4-sea-level-rise-and-implications-for-low-lying-islands-coasts-and-communities/) to announce its probable submergence by 2050. The very importance of this project is developing real-use tools that are very much required while doing any regional data analysis. And further using these developed tools for our research and debugging. So are you interested in knowing what tool  I’m working on? Just wait until the next blog, where I’ll be discussing the idea, scope, and use of my new tool. Until then, GoodBye, **Happy July!**
