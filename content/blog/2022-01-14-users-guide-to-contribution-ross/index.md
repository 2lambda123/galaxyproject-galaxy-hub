Galaxy is an important open science project, with a large and active global community that invites users and developers to join the collaboration, to help make the project even better.

You probably already use Galaxy without any direct cost. It is open source, so instead of charging a fee, the project offers opportunities to contribute your expertise and skills instead. A large part of Galaxy's success is attributable to the hundreds of individuals who have chosen to join in the work of making transparent,
shareable, open science computing readily available to the world's scientists. Motivations vary. Some work on Galaxy for a living. Others want to pay it forward or perhaps scratch an open source itch.

Whatever motivates individuals to start putting effort in, they generally get a lot out of it in return. In addition to the personal satisfaction of contributing to an important open science resource, they gain valuable professional experience, working on things they care about in collaboration with talented and friendly people, in an explicitly inclusive environment.

**This brief note is intended as a guide for potential contributors.**

### First things first, where to start?

Depending on your skill set and interests, activities are divided broadly and arbitrarily into *technical* and *community*. The distinction is only really useful for organising things, because active two way interchange and overlap is always needed to keep the project on track. In practice, there are a number of contributors who work in both areas and that helps with communication and integration.

### Technical
Source code forms the core of the project. It is a large scale, complicated, open source software engineering project, with many moving parts. The community engaged with that code now helps sustain and expand the project, providing a pool of talented external contributors, large enough to place Galaxy among the top 2% of OpenHub projects for [developer activity](https://www.openhub.net/p/galaxybx/factoids#FactoidAgeVeryOld)

If you would like to learn more about how you can contribute technical expertise, [Working Groups](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/) is the best place to start. There are a wide variety of specialised areas. These differentiations may appear odd, but they arose more or less organically, as a result of the past 16 years of project development.

### Community
The Galaxy community is an important project resource, and provides many opportunities for contributions that improve the sustainability, usefulness and growth of the project. There are also leadership opportunities in the Galaxy governance structures.

The [Outreach and Training WG](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/) addresses many issues that are community centered. This WG may be of interest to potential contributors to educational and training activities because it includes [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) collaborations

The Global Galaxy Steering Committee
[(GGSC)](https://galaxyproject.org/community/steering/) is a formal Galaxy governance structure concerned with community activities. It consists of investigators and other Galaxy community contributors, who plan and manage projects and initiatives focussed on supporting and extending the community.

The GGSC has now been in existence for a little more than a year, and offers a platform for new community initiatives. We are actively recruiting community leaders who want to initiate their own new projects, or want to participate in the current GGSC working groups. The main requirements are a willingness to dedicate time and energy to an active leadership role in Galaxy community governance. If you have suggestions or would like to learn more, please contact the GGSC chair at *ross.lazarus@gmail.com*
