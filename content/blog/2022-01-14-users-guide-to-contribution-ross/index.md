Galaxy is an open science computing project, with a large and active global community, that invites users and developers to join in and help make the project even better.

You may already use Galaxy without any direct cost. It is open source, so instead of charging a fee, the project offers opportunities to contribute your expertise and skills instead. A large part of Galaxy's success is comes from the hundreds of individuals who have chosen to join in the work of making transparent,
shareable, open science computing readily available to the world's scientists. 

Contributor motivations vary. Some work on Galaxy for a living. Others want to pay it forward or perhaps scratch an open source itch.

Whatever motivates individuals, they generally get a lot out of it in return, in addition to the satisfaction of contributing to an important open science resource. They gain valuable professional experience and skills, collaborating with talented and friendly people, working on problems they care about, in an explicitly inclusive environment.

### First things first, where to start?

Galaxy is a complicated project that can initially make it hard to figure out how it all works, or where your specific skill set and interests might fit. Essentially, there are two main activity areas activities are divided into ***technical*** and ***community***. The distinction is only really useful for organising things, because active two way interchange and overlap is always needed to keep the project on track. In practice, there are a number of contributors who work in both areas and that helps with communication and integration.

### Technical Development
It is a large scale, complicated, open source software engineering project. Source [code](https://github.com/galaxyproject) forms the core of the project deliverables.  Like the project itself, the code repository is complicated and made up of many interacting components and dependencies. The large community that has become engaged with that code now helps sustain the project, in part by providing a pool of talented external contributors, large enough to place Galaxy among the top 2% of OpenHub projects for [developer activity](https://www.openhub.net/p/galaxybx/factoids#FactoidAgeVeryOld)

If you would like to learn more about how you can contribute technical expertise, The [Working Groups](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/) page is the best place to start. There are a wide variety of specialised areas. These differentiations may appear odd, but they arose more or less organically, as a result of the past 16 years of project development.

### Community Development
In addition to a pool of developers, the community provides opportunities for contributions that have some specific aspect of the community as a target. These include community based collaborations to improve the sustainability, usefulness and growth of the community itself. In many cases, these projects will also involve technical aspects, but they rely primarily on other specialised kinds of skills and experience, such as in education and training.

The [Outreach and Training WG](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/) addresses many issues that are community centered. This WG may be of interest to potential contributors to educational and training activities because it includes [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) collaborations

The Global Galaxy Steering Committee
[(GGSC)](https://galaxyproject.org/community/steering/) is a formal Galaxy governance structure concerned with community activities. It consists of investigators and other Galaxy community contributors, who plan and manage projects and initiatives focussed on supporting and extending the community. The GGSC has now been in existence for a little more than a year, and offers a platform for new community initiatives. Community orking groups are active in a broad range of topics such as mentoring, onboarding new investigators to Galaxy, and small scale server administrator needs. New ideas are always welcome.

The Galaxy governance structures, such as the GGSC are open and offer leadership opportunities to those who seek them. The GGSC is actively recruiting community leaders who want to initiate their own new projects, or want to participate in the current GGSC working groups. The main requirements are a willingness to commit time and energy to an active leadership role. If you would like to learn more, please email the [GGSC chair](mailto:ross.lazarus@gmail.com)
