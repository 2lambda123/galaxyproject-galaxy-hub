FTP Upload
----------

For large files, FTP upload is also available on this server. Connect to port 23 with the same credentials you use to log into Galaxy. Once uploaded, open the Galaxy file upload menu, and click on the *Choose FTP file* button to import the files into your history.

As an example, a screenshot of the configuration settings for [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org) can be found [here](https://bioinf-galaxian.erasmusmc.nl/galaxy/static/photos/filezilla-ftp.jpg).
