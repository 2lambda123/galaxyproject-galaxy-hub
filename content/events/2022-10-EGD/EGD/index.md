The **European Galaxy Days** will be held  4 to 7 October 2022 in Freiburg, Germany. This four day gathering will be similar to the events we held in [2018](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2018-europe-dev/), [2016](https://galaxyproject.org//events/sg2016/), [2014](https://galaxyproject.org//events/sg2014/), and [2012](https://galaxyproject.org//events/switzerland2012/). The first two days will give an overview of the current state of the Galaxy framework with several talks, demonstrations and Birds of a Feather sessions. As part of a CoFest, the second two days offer the opportunity to continue the discussions, to code and hack as well as enjoy the Galaxy community.
