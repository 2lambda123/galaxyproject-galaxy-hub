It's time again to gather together, discuss recent and future Galaxy development and enjoy ourselves in Freiburg at the European Galaxy Days 2022!

To minimize travelling - and yes we recommend taking a train :-) - we are co-locating the EGD this year with the kick-off meeting of the 
EuroScienceGateway (ESG), an EU-funded project to build a network of national Galaxy servers and Pulsar endpoints in European clouds and HPC centers.

Our current plan (TM) is:

* Monday, Oct 3: Arrival day, welcome and get together in the city.
* Tuesday, Oct 4: Talks about recent and future Galaxy developments and general community updates (please let us know if you want to contribute a talk).
* Wednesday, Oct 5: Another round of talks in the morning and free slots for BOFs, ELIXIR Implementation Study meeting and spontaneous hack in the afternoon.
* Thursday, Oct 6: the European Science Gateway kick-off meeting - a lot of planning and throwing crazy ideas at the wall.
* Friday, Oct 7: We will end the week with a hackathon!

Please check this site for any updates or changes.
