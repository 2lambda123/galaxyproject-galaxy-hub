Its time again to gather together, discuss recent and future Galaxy development and enjoy ourself in Freiburg at the European Galaxy Days 2022!
To minimize travelling - and yes we recommend to take a train :-) - we are coolocating the EGD this year with the kickoff meeting of the 
European Science Gateway, an EU funded project to build a network of national Galaxy servers and Pulsar endpoints in European Clouds and HPC Centers.

Our current plan (TM) is:

* Arrival at Monday 3.10.2022 with welcome get together in the city
* Tuesday, talks about recent and future Galaxy developments and general community updates (please let us know if you want to contribute a talk)
* Wednesday, another round of talks in the morning and free slots for BOFs, ELIXIR IS meeting and spontanouse hack in the afternoon
* Thursday, the European Science Gateway kickoff meeting - a lot of planning and throwing crazy ideas at the wall
* We will end the week with a hackathon on Friday.

Please check this site for any updates or changes.
