 A new opportunity to engage with the community comes! 
 
 Join the __ELIXIR BioHackathon__ to discuss and implement ideas or projects related to challenges proposed by ELIXIR platforms (data, tools, compute, interoperability and training), ELIXIR communities (Human Data, Rare Diseases, Marine Metagenomics, Plant Science, Metabolomics and Proteomics), and a set of common challenges proposed by the sister BioHackathon organised in Japan.
