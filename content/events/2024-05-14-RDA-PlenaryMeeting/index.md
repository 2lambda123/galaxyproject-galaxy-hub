**The RDA 22nd Plenary Meeting**

The RDA invites individuals and groups at all stages of their careers to contribute to the discussions, meet data professionals, and get involved in the RDA community. Over the course of two weeks, RDA Working and Interest Groups, Communities of Practice and Birds of a Feather sessions will address the most significant challenges that data leaders face today, presenting ongoing research that are building the fundamentals for data science.
