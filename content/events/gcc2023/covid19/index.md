# COVID-19 conference policy

While significant strides have been made globally towards controlling the impact
of COVID-19, the virus remains a concern and the best way to manage its spread
is fluid. The conference organizers are committed to helping everyone feel and
stay safe so the conference COVID-19 policy will be evaluated and adjusted as
appropriate.

Overall, for GCC2023, we will follow the [guidelines from the host
institution](https://www.qut.edu.au/additional/coronavirus), the Queensland
University of Technology, and the [Australian federal
government](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19/international-travel).

In addition, the conference organizers will provide ample hand sanitizer
stations and face masks for those that choose we wear those.

If you have concerns or suggestions, please contact the
[organizers](/events/gcc2023/organizers/).
