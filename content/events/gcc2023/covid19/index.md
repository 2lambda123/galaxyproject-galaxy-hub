# COVID-19 conference policy

While significant strides have been made globally towards controlling the impact
of COVID-19, the virus remains a concern and the best way to manage its spread
is fluid. The conference organizers are committed to helping everyone feel and
stay safe so the conference COVID-19 policy will be evaluated and adjusted as
appropriate.

Overall, for GCC2023, we will follow the [guidelines from the host
institution](https://www.qut.edu.au/additional/coronavirus), the Queensland
University of Technology, the [Australian federal
government](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19/international-travel),
and the World Health Organization.

While wearing face masks at the event will not be mandated, participants are
welcome to do so and masks will be provided. We will also have red light, green
light indicators to display one's comfort levels with physical proximity. Ample
hand sanitizer stations will also be available.

If you are not feeling well, and/or test positive to COVID-19, please stay home
or in the hotel room and notify the organizers via email.

If you have concerns or suggestions, please contact the
[organizers](/events/gcc2023/organizers/).
