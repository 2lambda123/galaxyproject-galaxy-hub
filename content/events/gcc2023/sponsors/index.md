## Our thank you to the sponsors

We make a strong effort to seamlessly integrate sponsors and their events into
the broader GCC program, as well as promote participant engagement. Furthermore,
sponsor talks are generally scheduled immediately preceding or following a
keynote talk to maximize their attendance.
