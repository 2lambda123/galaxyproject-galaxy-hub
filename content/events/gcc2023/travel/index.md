## Brisbane, Australia

Yes, we are going to Australia this year!
[Brisbane](https://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/) is the capital of the state of
Queensland in Australia. It is a large, modern city with a population of over
2.5 million people. Located on the east coast of Australia, Brisbane has a
subtropical climate with mild winters (which is when GCC2023 will be held
there). The city is known for its beautiful parks and gardens, including the
Brisbane Botanic Gardens, South Bank Parklands, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary,
and many more.

Brisbane is also home to a thriving arts and culture scene, with numerous
galleries, museums, and performance venues. There is a great choice of
restaurants and cuisines, including Australian, Asian, and Japanese food.

Within an hour drive are Australian Zoo, Moreton Island, and Gold Coast as some of
the prime Australian travel destinations, offering a range of activities and
attractions such as surfing, hiking, and wildlife encounters.
