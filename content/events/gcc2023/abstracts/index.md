# GCC2023 Abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of Galaxy Community
Conferences.  These include long talks, short talks, poster presentations, and
demo presentations.  All of these are submitted by the community and go through
a peer review process before being accepted for the program.

**Abstract submission is not yet open.** Please check back here towards the end of February.
