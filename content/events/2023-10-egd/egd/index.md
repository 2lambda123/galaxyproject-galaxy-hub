The **European Galaxy Days** will be held from the 4th to 6th October 2023 in Freiburg, Germany. This 3-day gathering will be similar to the events we held in [2022](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2022-10-egd/), [2018](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2018-europe-dev/), [2016](https://galaxyproject.org//events/sg2016/), [2014](https://galaxyproject.org//events/sg2014/), and [2012](https://galaxyproject.org//events/switzerland2012/). The first two days will give an overview of the current state of the Galaxy framework with several talks, demonstrations and Birds of a Feather sessions. As part of a CoFest, the third day offer the opportunity to continue the discussions, to code and hack as well as enjoy the Galaxy community.
