The fifth [ELIXIR All Hands meeting](https://elixir-europe.org/events/elixir-excelerate-all-hands-meeting-2019)

This event is the occasion to bring together members of the ELIXIR community from across the ELIXIR Nodes,
and collaborators from partner organisations, in order to review ELIXIR achievements and activities so far
and discuss plans for the future.

During these 3 days, the Freiburg Galaxy team will be involved in Containers, Bioconda, Training and the
ELIXIR Galaxy community workshops.
