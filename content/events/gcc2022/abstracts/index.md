A core component of Galaxy Community Conferences are the presentations from the community.  These include long talks, lightning talks, poster presentations, and demo presentations.  All of these are submitted by the community and go through a peer review process before being accepted for the program.

# Key Dates

We are still working out our timeline for abstract submissions for talks, posters, and demos.  We can tell you that 

* Abstract submission will likely open when registration does, probably around the beginning of February
* The call for *talk* and *early poster/demo* abstract submissions will likely stay open for two months, and the final *poster/demo* abstract submission call will likely stay open for two months after that.
* If you submit an abstract, either talk or poster/demo, by the talk submission deadline, then you will be notified of your submission status at least two weeks before abstract submission closes.

# Guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then presentations) that will resonate with GCC2022 participants.

1. **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does the work use, describe, extend, deploy, benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem?  If it does not, then it may not reviewed.
1. **Compelling.** Is the work compelling?  Will GCC2022 participants find your presentation interesting?  Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on?
1. **Open Source / Open Access.**  Not all presented work / resources must be open source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason why it isn't.  For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company, behind a firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you learned, and any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem.  An abstract that merely highlights and inaccessible resource is not compelling.
1. **Project Update.** If an abstract is a project update for a project that has previously been presented at a GCC, then it needs to describe a significant update to be considered for a talk.  Minor updates submitted as talks will be offered a poster or demo spot.
