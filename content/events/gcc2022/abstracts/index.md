# GCC2022 Abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of Galaxy Community Conferences.  These include long talks, short talks, poster presentations, and demo presentations.  All of these are submitted by the community and go through a peer review process before being accepted for the program.

# Guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then presentations) that will resonate with GCC2022 participants.
1. **Limited to 500 words.** Please be concise and to the point. Abstract submission is a web form so no graphics or references are to be included.
1. **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does the work use, describe, extend, deploy, benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem?  If it does not, then it may not reviewed.
1. **Compelling.** Is the work compelling?  Will GCC2022 participants find your presentation interesting?  Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on?
1. **Open Source / Open Access.**  Not all presented work / resources must be open source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason why it isn't.  For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company, behind a firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you learned, and any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem.  An abstract that merely highlights and inaccessible resource is not compelling.
1. **Project Update.** If an abstract is a project update for a project that has previously been presented at a GCC, then it needs to describe a significant update to be considered for a talk.  Minor updates submitted as talks will be offered a poster or demo spot.
