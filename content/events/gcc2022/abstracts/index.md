# GCC2022 Abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of Galaxy Community
Conferences.  These include long talks, short talks, poster presentations, and
demo presentations.  All of these are submitted by the community and go through
a peer review process before being accepted for the program.

**Abstract submission is now closed**, but take a look at [the
schedule](https://gcc2022.sched.com/) for all the exciting talks coming up!

## Posters

If you are presenting a poster at GCC2022, maximum size for a poster can be 48"
x 48" (or 120cm x 120cm). The poster schedule will be posted on the [schedule
site](https://gcc2022.sched.com/overview/type/C.+Poster+%2F+Demo) with each
poster being assigned number to match to a poster panel. You can place your
poster on the first day for the conference and leave it up all the way until the
end but please be present at the poster during your scheduled poster showing.

# Guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then
presentations) that will resonate with GCC2022 participants.
1. **Limited to 500 words.** Please be concise and to the point. Abstract
   submission is a web form so no graphics or references are to be included.
1. **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does the work use, describe, extend, deploy,
   benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem?  If it does not, then it
   may not reviewed.
1. **Compelling.** Is the work compelling?  Will GCC2022 participants find your
   presentation interesting?  Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting
   results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on?
1. **Open Source / Open Access.**  Not all presented work / resources must be
   open source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason
   why it isn't.  For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company,
   behind a firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you
   learned, and any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem.  An
   abstract that merely highlights an inaccessible resource is not compelling.
1. **Project Update.** If an abstract is a project update for a project that has
   previously been presented at a GCC, then it needs to describe a significant
   update to be considered for a talk.  Minor updates submitted as talks will be
   offered a poster or demo spot.

# Option to publish in F1000 Galaxy gateway
Following GCC, you'll have an option to publish your slides or poster in the
[F1000 Galaxy gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy/). Besides
being a great collection of Galaxy-related content, each published artifact gets
a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), making it easier to reference in the future.
