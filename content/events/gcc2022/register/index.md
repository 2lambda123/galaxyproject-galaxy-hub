## Training Day, July 8

This preconference event is virtual, asynchronous, global, and free.  The GCC2022 Training Day will focus on introductory topics, many of which are prerequisites for training that is being offered in-person, during the meeting.  We recommend you look at the training offerings for Training Day, and during the conference when deciding if you should register for training day.

Cost: **Everyone: Free, for as long as there is space.**

## Meeting, July 17-20

**This is it! Our first in-person GCC since 2019.** The four day meeting will feature accepted and invited talks, poster, demo, and sponsor sessions, training sessions, Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) sessions, a conference dinner, and lots of time for networking.

Meeting registration includes admission to conference talks, poster/demo sessions, and all training during the conference.  **We strongly recommend that you decide on which training you want to take before you start your meeting registration process.**
