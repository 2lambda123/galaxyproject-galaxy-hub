## Training Day, July 8

This pre-conference event is virtual, asynchronous, global, and free.  The
GCC2022 Training Day will focus on introductory topics, many of which are
prerequisites for training that is being offered in-person, during the meeting.
We recommend you look at the training offerings for Training Day, and during the
conference when deciding if you should register for training day.

Cost: **Free, for as long as there is space**

## Meeting, July 17-20

**This is it! Our first in-person GCC since 2019.** The four day meeting will
feature accepted and invited talks, poster, demo, and sponsor sessions, training
sessions, Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) sessions, a conference dinner, and lots of
time for networking.

In-person meeting registration includes admission to conference talks,
poster/demo sessions, and all training during the conference.  **We strongly
recommend that you decide on which training you want to take before you start
your meeting registration process.**

Based on popular demand, there is also a **Webinar mode** option for attendance.
After registering for this option, you will get access to the live stream of the
main meeting talks. You will also get invited to the conference Slack where you
will have an opportunity to ask any questions of the presenters or poster
authors. Note that in-person training events or CoFest will not be streamed.
Also note that all speakers are required to attend in person.
