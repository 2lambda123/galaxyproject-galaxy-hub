GCC2022 features [separate Training Day, Conference, and CoFest events](/events/gcc2022/schedule/), which can be registered for separately or all at once.  Steep discounts are offered to students and postdocs, and for registering early.

# Registration

## Training Day, July 8

This preconference event is virtual, asynchronous, global, and free.  The GCC2022 Training Day will focus on introductory topics, many of which are prerequisites for training that is being offered in person, during the meeting.  We recommend you look at the training offerings for Training Day, and during the conference when deciding if you should register for training day.

Cost: **Everyone: Free, for as long as there is space.**

## Meeting, July 17-20

You can participate in the 4 day meeting either virtually or in-person.  Here's what is included in each

### Virtual

Registration rates for virtual participation will be very, very affordable.  However, what is included with virtual registration is limited to

* **Access to live broadcasts of all talk presentation sessions.**  There will be three talk sessions on each of the conference days, totalling almost 11 hours of presentation sessions.  If the conference offers any parallel talk presentation sessions, then both will be broadcast live.
* **Access to the conference chat rooms**, which will be either Slack or Element/Matrix based.  This includes access to the virtual conference help desk, as well as any topic-specific and general rooms on the chat platform.

Note that remote participants will *not* have access to poster/demo sessions, conference training sessions, birds-of-a-feather meetups (although you can always ask indiividual BoF organizers to include remote participants), and conference social events.

### In-Person

**This is it! Our first in-person GCC since 2019.** The four day meeting will feature accepted and invited talks, poster, demo, and sponsor sessions, training sessions, Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) sessions, a conference dinner, and lots of time for networking.

Meeting registration includes admission to the conference dinner, and all training during the conference.  **We strongly recommend that you decide on which training you want to take before you start your meeting registration process.**

### CoFest, July 21-23

You can register for 1, 2, or 3 days of CoFest.  The CoFest will have a minimal daily registration cost of under $10/day to help us defray costs.

## Lodging

When you register you can also sign up for lodging on campus in the residence halls.  This is a very affordable option, is on campus, and is close to nearby shops and restaurants.

There are also numerous nearby lodging options that are off-campus.  See the [Travel page](/events/gcc2022/travel/) for some options.

## Got kids?

GCC2022 enthusiastically welcomes your kids **and will offer subsidized [childcare](/events/gcc2022/childcare/) to meeting participant families.**  Registration for childcare is separate from registration for events.  See the [childcare](/events/gcc2022/childcare/) page for more.

## GCC2022 Fellowships

The Galaxy Community Fund will offer travel fellowships to attend GCC2022.  The application deadline will be posted here once registration opens.
