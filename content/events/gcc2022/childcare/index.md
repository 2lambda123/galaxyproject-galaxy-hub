# Childcare will be offered at GCC2022!

GCC2022 aims to make events accessible to parents. We encourage you to bring your kids and to please take advantage of the services that GCC2022 will offer. We aren't yet sure what childcare will look like.  It might be a link to a nanny service with vetted babysitters, on site care (as did in 2019) or an offsite day-care (as we did in 2018).  But, we do know some things:

* The cost of childcare will be subsidized by the conference
* Childcare will be available during 4 day meeting (July 16-19) and at least the first two days of the CoFest (July 20-22).
* Infants, nursing infants, nursing mothers, and parents are warmly welcomed during all meeting and CoFest events. (Remember baby Orson in 2018? We want more Orsons!)
* Please consider bringing your family to the conference dinner. (Remember Lucia's kids running around that same year?  We want your kids running around in 2022!)

*Watch this space.*
