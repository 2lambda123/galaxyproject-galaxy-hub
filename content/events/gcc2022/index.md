The **2022 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2022)** will bring together hundreds
of researchers, trainers, tool developers, software engineers, and
computational infrastructure providers, all addressing common challenges in data
intensive science using the [Galaxy data integration and analysis platform](/).

This annual gathering of the Galaxy community includes **training, talks,
posters, demos, Birds of a Feather meetups, and many other opportunities for
collaboration and networking**.  There is no better event to share your work and
learn form others working in Galaxy-related data-intensive science.

COVID-19 is (still) very much around us and to help each other have a safe event, GCC2022 has adopted a [COVID-19 policy](/events/gcc2022/conduct/#covid-19-policy). Take a look at the details but the gist of it is that **face masks are required while indoors**. Please keep that in mind at all times during the event. Also, we ask to **test daily** using the provided tests.

**Getting here is easy.**  The Twin Cities are served by the Minneapolis St Paul Airport (MSP), with direct flights from 44 states, Canada, Europe, and Mexico.  It is also **a short flight (or a scenic drive) from Madison, Wisconsin, the site of ISMB and BOSC 2022** (which is just before GCC).  The conference meeting area is served by rapid public transit.  Lodging will be available in on the conference hotel, and there are also many nearby hotels.  **See the [Travel page](/events/gcc2022/travel/) for details.**
