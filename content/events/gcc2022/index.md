The two downtowns are less than 10 miles apart and are connected by rapid transit that goes right through campus.  The Twin Cities offer a vibrant cultural, music, sports, and entertainment scene, with great access to the outdoors.  The Twin Cites are one of the most livable metro areas in the United States.
