The **2022 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2022)** will bring together hundreds of researchers, trainers, tool developers, software engineers, and  computational infrastructure providers, all addressing common challenges in data intensive science using the [Galaxy data integration and analysis platform](/).

This annual gathering of the Galaxy community includes **training, talks, posters, demos, Birds of a Feather meetups, and many other opportunities for collaboration and networking**.  There is no better event to share your work and learn form others working in data-intensive science.

GCC2022 will be hosted by the **[University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/)** in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The meeting will be **held at [Courtyard by Marriott Minneapolis Downtown](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mspdc-courtyard-minneapolis-downtown/)**, near the university campus and close to engaging neighborhoods, cultural attractions, public art and greenspace, restaurants, and much more. The venue area straddles the Mississippi River and no matter where you are, you're never far from nature with parks, trails, and waterways just a short walk away.

The University of Minnesota is located in the heart of the Twin Cities of [Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolis.org/) and [St. Paul](https://www.visitsaintpaul.com/) Minnesota.  The two downtowns are less than 10 miles apart and are connected by rapid transit.  The Twin Cities offer a vibrant cultural, music, sports, and entertainment scene, with great access to the outdoors.  The Twin Cites are one of the most livable metro areas in the United States.
