# Code of Conduct

<p class="Lead">We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.  If you participate in GCC2022, then you too are committed to this goal.</p>

GCC2022 will provide a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

**We are in the process of outlining a code of conduct that more fully describes expectations and processes for GCC2022 participants.  Until that Code of Conduct is ready, we will be governed by the [overall Galaxy community Code of Conduct](/community/coc/).**  

*Watch this space.*
