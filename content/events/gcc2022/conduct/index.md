# Code of Conduct

<p class="lead">
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.
If you participate in GCC2022, then you too are committed to this goal.
</p>

GCC2022 will provide a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, age or religion. We do not tolerate
harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference participants
violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without
a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Details of the the Code of Conduct can be read in the [Galaxy community Code of
Conduct](/community/coc/).

## COVID-19 policy

To protect participant safety, masks are required during all GCC2022 events,
with the following exceptions:
- You are presenting
- You are actively eating / drinking
- You are outside

If you see someone who has forgotten to put their mask back on, please gently
remind them.  Participants who refuse to wear a mask, or show a repeated pattern
of being unmasked will be barred from all remaining GCC2022 events, without a
refund.  This will be treated as a Code of Conduct violation.

If you feel sick, or have had close exposure, or are testing positive, then do
not attend in-person events.  If you have already attended some events and
become sick, please let the [conference organizers](/events/gcc2022/organizers/)
know, and let anyone you have spent significant time around (masked) or some
time around (unmasked) so they can take appropriate precautions.

GCC2022 is not requiring proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. Neither
of those methods guarantees that you are actually negative.

Please, letâ€™s keep each other safe.
