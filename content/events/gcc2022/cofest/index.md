## GCC2022 CollaborationFest (CoFest!)

This one, two, or three day event (up to you!) gathers community members who are interested in contributing to Galaxy's available tool set, documentation, training materials, code base, and anywhere else that expands the Galaxy ecosystem.

CoFest participants will coalesce around shared interests and address common topics related to those interests. These clusters form before, at the beginning of, and throughout CollaborationFest and will be fluid and highly interactive with each other.

## Goals!

<p class="lead"><strong>Our goals are to expand the contributor community and the Galaxy ecosystem.</strong></p>

That's a short sentence, but it is very deliberately worded:

* Our **first goal is to expand the contributor community**.  This CoFest is first and foremost about welcoming new contributors and helping you learn the resources and meet the people that will help you contribute.
* The **second goal is to expand the Galaxy Ecosystem**. Not just the code, but the whole ecosystem. That includes training, tools, best practice workflows, documentation, test cases, translations, infrastructure, and yes, even code.

This is a CollaborationFest. Not a hackathon, not a codefest, but a *CollaborationFest.*

Welcome aboard.

## Location

CoFest will be held at the University of Minnesota (so not at the same venue as the main meeting). The campus is minutes walk from the conference hotel. You are welcome to stay at the hotel, the dorms, or an alternative place of your choice but remember to book your lodging for the duration of CoFest.

## Cost

There is a $9 per day cost to register for CoFest. The fees will be used to provide food and drinks at the event for the participants.
