Simon and Bj√∂rn from the Europe Galaxy team will attend the Metabolomics Tool developement workshop (MetaboFlow hackathon) at EBI in Hinxton (Great Britain) and help
the Metabolomic community to polish new Galaxy tools so they can be distributed to the Galaxy Tool Shed.
Nicola Soranzo from the Earlham Institute, IUC and ELIXIR community member will join us as well.

We are looking forward to a few very productive days and many more tools for Metabolomic research in a Galaxy instance near to you.
