**GCC2019 was held in Freiburg, Germany, 1-6 July.**  Like [previous Galaxy Community Conferences](/gcc/), GCC2019 it [featured](https://gcc2019.sched.com/) invited talks, accepted talks, [posters](https://gcc2019.sched.com/overview/type/C.+Posters+%2F+Demos+%2F+Sponsors/Posters) and [demos](https://gcc2019.sched.com/overview/type/C.+Posters+%2F+Demos+%2F+Sponsors/Demos), [birds-of-a-feather (BoF) gatherings](https://gcc2019.sched.com/overview/type/D.+Break+%2F+Social+%2F+Networking+%2F+Meal/BoFs), multiple days of collaborative work, and plenty of opportunities to network with your fellow data-intensive researchers and practitioners.  If you are working in data-intensive life science, there was no better place to be.

[Freiburg](https://visit.freiburg.de/en) is on the edge of the Black Forest, and is famous for its architecture, cobblestone streets and historic districts, and is home to one of Germany's oldest universities (and our host)! Freiburg is in the Baden wine-growing region and *is the sunniest city in Germany.*

GCC2019 will be held at [Konzerthaus Freiburg](https://www.konzerthaus.freiburg.de/) in central Freiburg, adjacent to the [Freiburg train station](https://www.bahnhof.de/bahnhof-de/Freiburg__Breisgau__Hbf-1039062).
