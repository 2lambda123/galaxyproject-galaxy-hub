# Guide for WGs: Hosting a Papercut event

If your working group is the host for the next papercut event, here is what we need from you for the event to be successful:

* Find **5-10 small to medium issues** that you want to see worked on. Triage them a bit to make sure a contributor has any pertinent information they may need to be successful. 
* Find **1 or 2 bigger topics** that you want a lot of feedback or collaboration on, if applicable.
* Decide if you want to have video calls or not. If you do, we can pre-schedule them ahead of time.
* **Be avaialable.** Talk about who's going to take point on certain issues or time zones. 
* Make the event yours. We welcome help with design decisions for the advertisements, formatting on the event page, etc. 
* Have fun!
