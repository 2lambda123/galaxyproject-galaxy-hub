# Brno, Czech Republic

**[Brno](https://www.amazingczechia.com/destinations/brno/) is a captivating,
mid-size city in the heart of Europe**, offering a captivating blend of the old
and the new. The city's historic center boasts dazzling medieval and Baroque
buildings, including the iconic [Špilberk
Castle](https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/place/spilberk-castle/) and the stunning
[Cathedral of St. Peter and
Paul](https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/place/cathedral-of-st-peter-and-paul/).

Brno is also a hub of education and innovation - including the GCC2024 host,
[Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en) - contributing to its dynamic and
forward-thinking atmosphere. With a thriving arts scene, lively cafes, and a
deep connection to Czech history, Brno is a city that seamlessly marries
tradition with modernity, making it a fascinating destination for GCC2024
attendees.

The Czech Republic has its own currency, the czech crown, but many places accept payments by card.
There are many cash exchange points in the city center which offer exchanges of most currencies at good rates.

[Vila Tugendhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Tugendhat) was built in 1929–1930 for Greta and Fritz Tugendhat to a design by the German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Its history is at least as fascinating as its cultural significance. It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2001.
