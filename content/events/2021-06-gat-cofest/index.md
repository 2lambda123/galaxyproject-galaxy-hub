As the [2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition) draws near ([training](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/) starts June 28) the instructors behind the [Galaxy Admin Track](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/admin-track) (and [Galaxy Admin Training events](/events/2021-01-admin-training/))  would like to gather to address [some lingering issues](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/2274) before GCC.  

The GAT CoFest will be held Tuesday-Thursday, June 1-4. if you think you'll be able to help out, please review and self-assign anything you're interested in addressing, or ask questions about anything you want clarification on.

We are using the [Galaxy Admins Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/admins) for live chat during, before, and after the event.

We hope you'll join us.
