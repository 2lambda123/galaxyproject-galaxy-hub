Upcoming (and past) events with Galaxy-related content.

The events listed here are also available in the [Galaxy Events Google
Calendar](https://bit.ly/gxycal).  The [Galaxy Other Events Google
Calendar](https://bit.ly/gxyothercal) lists additional events that are relevant
to the Galaxy Community, but that are not known to feature significant Galaxy
content.

Some events are part of a series:

* [Galaxy Webinar Series](/events/webinars/)
* [Galaxy Developer Round Table meetups](/community/devroundtable/)
* [CollaborationFests](/events/cofests/) and [Papercuts CoFests](/events/cofests/papercuts/)

If you know of any event that should be added to this page and/or to the Galaxy
Event Calendar, please add it here or send it to outreach@galaxyproject.org.
For events prior to this year, see the [Events
Archive](/events/archive/).
