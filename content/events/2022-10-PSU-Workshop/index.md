<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  Free registration is <b>required</b> for this workshop. This will allow us to prepare well and make it as effective as possible. Please use this form to register.
</div>

This workshop is for you if:

- You generate *any* types of sequence data (Sanger, Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, Pacific Biosciences) 
- Use sequence data to perform *any* types of analyses (variation detection, Genome Assembly, ChIP-seq, RNAseq [including single cell], Metagenomics, etc...)
- Work with proteomic, metabolomics, or imaging data
- Work in computational chemistry

The workshop will be divided in six parts. The first five cover analysis of data from the standpoint of researchers who generate and analyze the data.  The last part is aimed at developers who want to integrate their tools into Galaxy or develop automated analyses utilizing Galaxy workflows and infrastructure. 
 
| When?        | What? |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| October 31  | What is it good for: Overview of the system, what it can do, first analysis |
| November 7  | History and data upload: Getting data from one dataset to 100,000 samples |
| November 28 | Dataset collections: Organization and analysis of hierarchical data |
| December 5  | Galaxy tool ecosystem: What can you do with > 4,000 tools |
| December 12 | Galaxy workflows: Automating analyses and constructing complex pipelines |
| December 19 | Galaxy for developers: Adding tools and using API |
