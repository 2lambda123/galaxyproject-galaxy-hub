*Please join our Outreachy interns - Pia, Rahmot, and Chinonye - in celebrating their contributions to the Galaxy Community!*

Our interns have been hard at work over the past few months, focusing on two main projects: one is a **Galaxy Mentorship Network** for folks joining the Galaxy Community, the other is a **Galaxy Community Onboarding Playbook**.  Both will undoubtedly lead to a more helpful, more welcoming Galaxy community for newcomers!

Our interns are excited to share their work with the community and recieve feedback. Please join us to show appreciation for their wonderful contributions!
