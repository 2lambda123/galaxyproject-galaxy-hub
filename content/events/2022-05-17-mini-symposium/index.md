Due to proliferation of new data generation technologies microbial biology has become a data driven science. Yet there is still a limited "mixing"
between researchers studying biological questions and their computational colleagues. The goal of the mini-conference is to bring
together representatives of two sides (“wet” and “dry”) and discover the ways in which they can be more aware of each other’s
challenges and priorities. The unique combination of speakers will cover the following areas:

* Analysis of microbial communities
* Experimental evolution
* Phylogenetic reconstruction
* Analysis of recombination
* Analysis of selection
* Data logistics and analysis automation
