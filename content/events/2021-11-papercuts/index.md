*Paper cuts are annoying but easy to fix friction points. [Paper cuts CoFests](/events/cofests/papercuts/) are virtual, global, day-long events that improve the Galaxy ecosystem by addressing these issues.  They are also an opportunity for new contributors to become better connected with the Galaxy community.*

The November PaperCuts CoFest will be held in conjunction with the [November Galaxy Training Network (GTN) CoFest day](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/1712). Want to improve Galaxy, and get involved with Galaxy? Please join us on November 18.

**Goals**

* Make the Galaxy experience be a pleasure and be productive by removing and reducing irritants.
* Grow the Galaxy *contributor* community by holding regular events.
* Identify easy but informative issues to fix.
* Work together and enjoy the community.
* Dedicate time together for bug-fixing.
* Make reducing paper cuts fun.

This will be a 24h event, spanning all time zones with our worldwide community. We'll start at 09:00 Melbourne time, and end at 16:00 Portland time.

## Developer Quick Dive Videos

If working the core Galaxy engine and interface is your goal, then take a look at the [Developer Quick Dives](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8Ro-V0mZboQjj40RimRZ8n) videos.  These short videos (2 minutes or less) demonstrate how to do common tasks in Galaxy development.  Take a peek.


## Before the event

If you are a Galaxy user or admin, you can create, or tag existing GitHub issues for any irritating, but likely easily fixed bugs (make a guess). These can be in any part of Galaxy, not just the core engine, and includes training, documentation, and other software.

If you don't have a GitHub or Gitter (or Elements/Matrix) account yet, then set them up (in that order).

If you have time, and want to learn more about contributing you are encouraged to review:

* [A collection of short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8Ro-V0mZboQjj40RimRZ8n), highlighting how to do common useful tasks during Paper Cuts and beyond.
* [Development in Galaxy tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/).
* [Contributing to the Galaxy Training Material tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/).
* [Galaxy on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject) - see what projects are supported and find the one that speaks to you. Pay particular attention to each project's CONTIBUTING.md files.

## During the event

We will be on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby) for chat all day long, and on 3 calls spread across the day. Please take advantage of both to communicate with your collaborators around the world.
