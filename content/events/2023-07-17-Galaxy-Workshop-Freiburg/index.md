We are offering a Galaxy workshop on HTS data analysis. This is a beginner workshop at the University of Freiburg and we will spend a full week and full day with different topics and learn about Galaxy and analysis of biological data. 
The first day starts with an introduction to Galaxy and then we will have 4 different topics (1 per day) in data analysis. 
Participants can select 4 topics out of e.g. genome assembly, RNA-Seq data analysis, ChIP-Seq data analysis, Variant Calling etc. (see application form).
