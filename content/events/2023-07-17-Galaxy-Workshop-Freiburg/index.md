We are offering another **Galaxy workshop on High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data analysis** on-site (not online, not hybrid) from 17-21st July 2023. This course is a beginner workshop at the University of Freiburg and we will spend a full week with different topics and learn about Galaxy as data analysis platform and the analysis of biological data. 
The first day starts with an introduction to Galaxy and then we will have 4 different topics (1 per day) in data analysis. For the hands-on course, we will use the [training material](https://training.galaxyproject.org) from the Galaxy Training Network.
For the workshop, the participants can select 4 topics out of e.g. genome assembly, RNA-Seq data analysis, ChIP-Seq data analysis, Variant Calling etc. (topics to select see application form). From the topic wishlist, we will create a program for the workshop.
As we have limited places, please apply via this [application form](https://forms.gle/umsFVGFd9cipbVxk6). 

We will inform the participants about a successful application until end of June 2023.
