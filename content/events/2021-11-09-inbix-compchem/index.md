We will be contributing to the Indian Conference on Bioinformatics (Inbix2021), providing a tutorial on the tools and workflows available for protein-ligand docking and cheminformatics in Galaxy.

In addition, our collaboration partner Chris Barnett, from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cape Town, will give a keynote talk on 'Structural Bioinformatics and Cheminformatics using Galaxy', providing a general introduction to the Galaxy computational chemistry community.
