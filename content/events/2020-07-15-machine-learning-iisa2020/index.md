**Machine Learning in Bioinformatics using Galaxy at 11th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications**  


**Description:**

This workshop is an online event (15th July 2020, 14:00-17:00 CEST) that intends to facilitate the training and discourse amongst bioinformatics researchers interested in machine learning using Galaxy. It will be a half-day event, including three sessions and during this workshop we will introduce Galaxy and train researchers to use Galaxy for machine learning analysis.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Familiarize participants with Galaxy,
* Provide the basics of machine learning and its variants,
* Learn how to do classification and regression using Galaxy,
* Learn how to use Galaxy's machine learning tools

**Prerequisites:**

Introduction to Galaxy or equivalent experience
