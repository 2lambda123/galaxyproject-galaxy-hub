The first [Galaxy conference](https://galaxyafrica.sanbi.ac.za/) will be held in Africa, in Cape Town. It is an opportunity to learn from leading bioinformaticists, systems administrators and engineers about Galaxy and accessible, reproducible analysis of biological data. 

During these 3 days, Björn and Bérénice will give keynote talks and help for the training sessions (Galaxy introduction, Microbial Variant Calling, Metagenomics and Admin).
