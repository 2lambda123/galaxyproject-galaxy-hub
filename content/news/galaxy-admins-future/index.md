The [GalaxyAdmins group](/community/galaxy-admins/) is coming up on it's one year anniversary and this is a good time to discuss where the group should go moving forward.  See the [GalaxyAdmins Future Directions page](/community/galaxy-admins/future/) for a summary of issues, including:

* [Goals and Activities](/community/galaxy-admins/future/#galaxyadmins-goals-and-activities)
* [Leadership Models and Selection](/community/galaxy-admins/future/#leadership)
* and a summary of the [group's history](/community/galaxy-admins/future/#history).

These topics are currently being discussed in email thread.  Whatever consensus and plan we reach will be posted to the [wiki page](/community/galaxy-admins/future/).  Ideally we should have a plan of action in place before [GCC2103](/events/gcc2013/) at the end of June.
