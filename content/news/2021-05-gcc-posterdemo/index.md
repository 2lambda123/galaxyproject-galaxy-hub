Poster/demo presentations have been a key component of GCCs since [GCC2013 in Oslo](/src/events/gcc2013/index.md).  They are an excellent way to more fully present, discuss, and demonstrate your work.  The **[Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition)** is using Remo as our conference platform and this has many advantages for presenting your work:

* Each poster/demo will be assigned its own named table in the Poster/Demo building,
* Up to 8 people can interact at each poster/demo table simultaneously.
* The Remo platform encourages video, audio, and chat interaction within tables.
* People will be able to see if someone is at a table to answer questions, before they join the table.
* Posters are not limited to just one big PDF.  In fact we don't even require that format.  Remo tables each have a whiteboard, where you can post PDFs, links, videos, images, and even live drawing.
* You can also share your screen with others at your table.

**Poster/Demo abstract submission is open through June 14.**  Abstracts are limited to 1750 characters.  Conference registration closes June 25.  Early registration ends June 8.
