The [June 2014 Galaxy Update Newsletter](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/) is out!  There's a lot going on in the project and the community right now.  The big news for the coming month is

* **[GCC2014 registration closes June 6!](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#gcc2014-june-30---july-2-baltimore)**
    (OK, that's a lie, but after June 6, late registration rates kick in, and you don't want to pay those.)
    * **[GCC2014 starts June 30](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#gcc2014-june-30---july-2-baltimore)!**
    * **The first ever [GCC Hackathon starts June 28](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#galaxy-hackathon-at-gcc2014)!**
* After a very long and productive life, the [Galaxy-User mailing list is retiring on June 6](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#galaxy-user-being-retired-june-6).  (Don't worry. [It's been replaced by Galaxy Biostar](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#galaxy-user-being-retired-june-6).)

[There are also at least 14 other Galaxy related events](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#other-events) in the next two months in Thailand, Canada, France, the United States, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia, and Brazil.

And, in the past month there were:

* [49 new papers](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#new-papers)
* [One new public server (deepTools)](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#new-public-servers)
* [One new Galaxy deployment description (deepTools)](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#galaxy-community-hubs)
* and [a stunning number of ToolShed contributions](/galaxy-updates/2014-06/#toolshed-contributions)
