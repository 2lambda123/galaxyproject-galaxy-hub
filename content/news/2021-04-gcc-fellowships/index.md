**Note: The fellowship application deadline has been extended.  See [the announcement](/news/2021-05-gcc-extended/).**

**[2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition) will be held 28 June through July 10, and will be [virtual, affordable, and globally accessible](/news/2021-02-gcc-virtual/).**

**[Registration](/news/2021-04-gcc-reg/) and [abstract submission](/news/2021-04-gcc-abstracts/) are now open.**

GCC2021 includes a week of training, a 3 day conference, and a multi-day CollaborationFest.  It is an excellent venue for sharing your work and learning how others are addressing challenges in data-intensive science.

But is only an excellent opportunity if you can participate.  Events will either be around-the-clock (Training, CoFest), or offered twice each day, 9 hours apart (Meeting).  Geography will not be a barrier to participating in GCC2021.  

# GCC2021 Fellowships

The Galaxy Community Fund is offering fellowships to students, post-docs, and other non-profit / academic / government researchers based in [lower, lower-middle and upper-middle income countries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFR1b8Al0DE0Ovn1pFJYlLchVUl2At82Dt4MRudvtRY/edit?usp=sharing) who will benefit from attending GCC2021, and for whom the [cost of registration](/news/2021-04-gcc-reg/) is a barrier.

Fellowships will cover the full registration for any GCC2021 events awardees want to attend. Interested?  **Apply by May ~~7~~ 17.**
