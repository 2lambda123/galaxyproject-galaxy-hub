The [May 2014 Galaxy Update Newsletter](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/) is out!  There's a lot going on in the project and the community right now.  The big news in the past month is the move [from the Galaxy-User mailing list to Galaxy Biostar](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#galaxy-biostar) for user support.  This has been running for a week now, and has been very well received.  

The other big news is upcoming events.  **[Early registration for GCC2013 closes May 23](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#gcc2014-june-30---july-2-baltimore)**.  [Register now](/events/gcc2014/register/) and save more than 70% on registration costs, and [Training Day](/events/gcc2014/training-day/) registration is an additional 55% off if you register for both at the same time.  We are also pleased to [announce this year's keynote speaker](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#keynote-speaker-steven-salzberg) and the first ever [GCC Hackathon](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#galaxy-hackathon-at-gcc2014).  

There's also a [Galaxy UK Tour](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#uk-may-2014-galaxy-tour) which is visiting Norwich and Edinburgh in May, and [there are at least 17 other Galaxy related events](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#other-events) in the next 70 days in Norway, France, *online*, Croatia, Thailand, Canada, the US, the Netherlands, and Australia

As always, there are [new papers](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#new-papers) (47 of them, including four we highlighted), [new public Galaxy Servers](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#new-public-servers) ([Globus Genomics Proteomics](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#globus-genomics-proteomics) and [SunLab Galaxy](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#sunlab)), [new jobs](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#whos-hiring) (7 postings in 6 countries), [new tools in the project ToolShed](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#galaxy-project-toolshed-new-repositories) (um, *lots*), and a [new public ToolShed](/galaxy-updates/2014-05/#new-public-toolsheds) (at the [Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences (DTL)](http://www.dtls.nl/dtl/).
