It's been a year since [James Taylor](/jxtx/) passed away.  To remember him, and mark his upcoming birthday (May 18) we would like to create a community video. We are asking you to tell us your favorite story about James in ~ 30 seconds. We will combine your clips into a community video that will be prominently featured on all Galaxy-related sites.

Here is what we will need you to do before April 30:

1. Think of your favorite story/interaction/event involving James.
2. Pick a nice location and record the video!
3. The video should be:
    * in a high-resolution
    * without background noise
    * in a horizontal orientation (not vertical!)
    * â‰² 30 seconds in length
4. Deposit video file to your Google Drive or Dropbox folder (or any other location that would allow us to retrieve it)
5. Send a link to the video, your name and location as you would like them to appear in the final video to: outreach@galaxyproject.org

Thank you all in advance and please feel free to send this to other friends of James.
