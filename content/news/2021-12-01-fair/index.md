The GTN does a lot of work to adhere to the best practices for FAIR training materials as set out in Garcia et al. 2020 and a lot of this work is behind-the-scenes or automatic from the infrastructure we provide, and we wanted to highlight that for educators and organisers who want to use GTN materials. This is one of the ways the GTN works to makes itself a fantastic platform training. Find out how contributing simple markdown tutorials can result in fantastically FAIR training.
