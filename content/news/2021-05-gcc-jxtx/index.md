**We are very pleased to announce that, thanks to an anonymous donation, we have additional funding for up to 100 conference fellowships for the [2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition) donated in honor of [James Taylor](/jxtx/).**  These fellowships cover all conference registration costs, and are available to students and post-docs based anywhere in the world.

GCC2021 will be held June 28 through July 10, and feature a week of training, a 3 day conference, and a multi-day CollaborationFest.  It is an excellent venue for sharing your work and learning how others are addressing challenges in data-intensive science.  The Training Week and CoFest will run around-the-clock, and the meeting content will be offered twice daily, 9 hours apart.  *Geography will not be a barrier to participating in GCC2021.*

But GCC2021 is only an excellent opportunity if you are able to participate.  *These fellowships ensure that cost will also not be a barrier to participating.*

Fellowship applications are open until May 17.  If you are a student or post-doc working in data-intensive science then you are strongly encouraged to apply.  The application is brief.
