This week [we](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/freiburg/people) are celebrating already 11 million datasets, 6 million jobs run on [UseGalaxy.EU](https://usegalaxy.eu) and 8 thousand users. Wow!!

This would not be possible without the support of [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/), [ELIXIR](http://elixir-europe.org/),
[EOSC](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud) and the Freiburg [Faculty of Medicine](http://www.med.uni-freiburg.de).
