During 2nd to the 5th of May, Engy Nasr from the Freiburg Galaxy team travelled to Hinxton, England to join the [**Applied Bioinformatics & Public Health Microbiology 2023**](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/applied-bioinformatics-public-health-microbiology-20230503/).

The 9th Applied Bioinformatics and Public Health Microbiology conference, which took place in the wellcome connecting Campus, provided a multidisciplinary forum to demonstrate how advances in microbial and viral genomics, bioinformatics, data science, and sequencing technology are being used to meet the needs of public health.

This year’s meeting focused on how these advances are transforming public health across the globe, including lessons learned from the SARS-Cov2 pandemic. The conference included sessions exploring public health genomics, genomic epidemiology, metagenomics for surveillance, and new bioinformatics approaches – focusing on pipelines and data management. A large proportion of the programme was chosen from submitted abstracts.

The conference aim is to share best practices for implementing genomics technology in routine, frontline diagnostics and surveillance, with a particular focus on the implications of using data-driven genomics approaches in public health. The conference also provided an opportunity for bioinformaticians working in this area to exhibit the innovative tools that they have developed.

The conference attracts international participants working in bioinformatics or microbiology research or public health, including reference laboratories or hospital settings. This conference had strong representation from clinical microbiologists and clinical bioinformaticians, to ensure appropriate migration of these technologies to diagnostic and surveillance applications.

On the first day; there were two talks sessions followed by a poster session. 111 posters were presented on the first and the second day. The first talks session was about new approches in bioinformatics and the second was about genomic epidemiology in the field.

On the second day; we had three talks sessions; two of them were about the public health and the third was about metagenomics for survellance. In between we had a bioinformatics showcase where I presented the Pathogen Detection workflow we created in Galaxy along with its [**training material**](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/pathogen-detection-from-nanopore-foodborne-data/tutorial.html). There were 16 abstracts presented in the bioinformatics showcase, and we won the award as the best abstract presented.

On the third and last day; we had a panel discussion regarding preparing for the next pandemic then we had a closing session where Chikwe Ihekweazu from the [**WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence**](https://pandemichub.who.int/) gave the final talk annoncing the launching of the [**International Paqthogen Surveillance Network (IPSN)**](file:///home/nasr/Downloads/9789240046979-eng-1.pdf) on the 20th of May 2023
