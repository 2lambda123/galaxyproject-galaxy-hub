Our new GTN material has been published last week along with multiple up coming workshops: ["Pathogen detection from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy - Foodborne Edition"](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/pathogen-detection-from-nanopore-foodborne-data/tutorial.html)



## Training Idea
A workflow has been developed under the [__EOSC-Life industry call__](https://www.eosc-life.eu/industrycall/) project for creating an **Accessible** and **scalable** workflow for foodborne pathogens detection, identification and tracking for Nanopore sequenced data. Using Galaxy plaform we were able to create a [__FAIR__](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) workflow to agnostically detect pathogens anywhere not only in food. A training material in the Metagenomics category in the [__GTN__](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) has been created to guide learners and users to use and adapt the workflow. 

The training includes two versions:

- A **Short Version**: where learners will run 5 prebuilt workflows, such that at the end they have the full workflow running.
- A **Long Version**: Where a step by step, tool by tool, is presented along with its parameters for the learners to run

The workflow or the step by step tools used in the training can be summaried as follows:

## Workshops

- The [__first workshop__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2023-02-02-foodborne-pathogen-detection-workshop/) conducted on the training was on the 2nd of Feburary 2023. 35 on-site and online participants from different background knowledge have attended the workshop. The workshop started with an introduction about Galaxy and the GTN, an introduction to the EOSC-Life industry call Foodborne pathogen detection project and finally our new GTN material was explained.

17 of the attending participants have answered the survey questions and here are some graphs of their feedback - Created by Bérénice Batut.

- From the 20th till the 24th of Feburary, the training will be also part of the [__High-Throughput Data Analysis workshop with Galaxy (HTS)__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2023-02-20-freiburg-workshop/)

- Nevertheless, the traing will be recorded and presented at the [__GTN 2023 Smörgåsbord__](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord3/) in May.
