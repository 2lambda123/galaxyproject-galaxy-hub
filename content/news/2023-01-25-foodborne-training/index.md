Food contamination with pathogens are a major burden on our society. Globally, they affect an estimated 600 million people a year and impact socioeconomic development at different levels. These outbreaks are mainly due to Salmonella spp. followed by Campylobacter spp. and Noroviruses.

The evolution of techniques in the last decades has made possible the development of methods to quickly identify responsible pathogen using their **DNA and without prior isolation**. Long-read sequencing tehcniques like ONT make these methods even **easier and more practical to identify strains quicker and with fewer reads**.

In this tutorial, using direct Nanopore sequencing data, we show how to

1. **agnostically detect pathogens** (what exactly is this pathogen and what is the degree of its severity (its virulence factors) from data extracted directly (without prior cultivation) from a potentially contaminated sample (e.g. food like chicken, cow, etc.,) and sequenced using Nanopore
2. **compare different samples to track** the possible source of contamination

Our new GTN material has been published last month along with multiple up coming workshops: ["Pathogen detection from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy - Foodborne Edition"](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/pathogen-detection-from-nanopore-foodborne-data/tutorial.html)


## The story behind the training
A workflow has been developed under the [__EOSC-Life industry call__](https://www.eosc-life.eu/industrycall/) project for creating an **Accessible** and **scalable** workflow for foodborne pathogens detection, identification and tracking for Nanopore sequenced data. Using Galaxy plaform we were able to create a **FAIR** workflow to agnostically detect pathogens anywhere not only in food. A training material in the Metagenomics category in the [__GTN__](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) has been created to guide learners and users to use and adapt the workflow. 

The training includes two versions:

- A **Short Version**: where learners will run 5 prebuilt workflows, such that at the end they have the full workflow running.
- A **Long Version**: Where a step by step, tool by tool, is presented along with its parameters for the learners to run

The workflow or the step by step tools used in the training can be summaried as follows:

## Workshops

The [__first workshop__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2023-02-02-foodborne-pathogen-detection-workshop/) conducted on the training was on the 2nd of Feburary 2023. **35** on-site and online participants from different background knowledge have attended the workshop. The workshop started with an introduction about Galaxy and the GTN, an introduction to the EOSC-Life industry call Foodborne pathogen detection project and finally our new GTN material was explained.

## Workshop Details
We organized a practical workshop for (foodborne) pathogen detection from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy on February 2nd as a 1-day hybrid (F2F at FHNW Muttenz, Switzerland and online), free and practical workshop.

More than **90 people registered**, 53% male, with diverse career stages and locations:

**63 confirmed** their registration and gave us more information about their motivation in participating in the workshop.

To help prepare for the course, we also questioned them about their background in the generation of pathogen sequencing data, using Galaxy, but also about their confidence about the topics, here are their answers:

As we expected and given the target, we had for this training, **most participants were new or beginner to Galaxy** but also in the data analysis, especially of pathogen sequencing data.

The workshop took place at FHNW Muttenz, Switzerland, and simultaneously broadcasted online via Zoom, with some instructors and helpers on each setup.
 
After a short Welcome and general information talk, we dived into a short Introduction to Galaxy with [__slides__](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/slides.html#1) and a [__hands-on tutorial__](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/slides.html#1), led by Bérénice Batut. After that, Anna Henger gave a short talk introducing pathogen detection from the wet lab perspective. After the (lunch) break, Engy Nasr led the main tutorial of the day: Pathogen detection from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy - Foodborne Edition.

At the end of the workshop, we summarised everything, shared extra resources (tutorials, events, etc), and asked participants to fill up a survey.

During the day, all information and links were shared in a shared Google document. Questions from onsite participants were loudly onsite and answered by onsite helpers. Online participants were requested to ask their questions in a dedicated Slack channel, answered by an online helper. In both setups, the interesting questions were repeated loudly by instructors and tracked in the shared Google document, so they could be reused to prepare for further training.

90% of the participants registered for online participation but many did not show up. In the end, we had around 35 participants both online and onsite. 17 answered our survey. Globally, the feedback is good:

Despite 2 answers reported accessibility issues, due to the hybrid setup making it sometimes hard to hear people in the onsite audience and difficult to follow the steps in the second part of the day when multiple things were done at once, but he instructors were able to repeat the steps, they feel comfortable learning in this workshop environment. They feel comfortable interacting with instructors, who were enthusiastic, knowledgeable about the content, and able to answer questions

In detail, they liked the well-documented and detailed training materials with the hands-on part and data interpretation in addition to Slack for interactions and prompt answers. The instructions are very clear on what to do. The instructors are also knowledgeable about the materials of the workshop. 
One mentioned loving the fact that this workshop is accessible for those who live in Indonesia to learn more about analysis and tools of Nanopore sequencing

They raised some concerns about the structure of the workshop with maybe a longer workshop or organized a bit differently to be able to do all the steps and explain them in more details. Indeed,  the second part was pretty unclear to follow and interpret results. One also suggested having an overview of all the important tools. We will process all comments to improve our training and delivery for next time.

Anyway, they mostly agree that they can immediately apply what they learned and they would recommend the workshop
