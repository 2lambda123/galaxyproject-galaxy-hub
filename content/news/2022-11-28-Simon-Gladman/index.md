## Have you seen my new watch?

[Simon Gladman](/blog/2018-12-cotm-simon-gladman/) loved unusual watches. During European Galaxy days this past October Simon was showing all of us his latest solar watch.
He was passionate about everything that he did. He was a cheesemaker, [a firefighter](https://www.topinfoguide.com/death-obituary/simon-gladman-obituary-news-in-loving-memory-of-simon-gladman-from-wyndham-vale-fire-brigade/), a board game enthusiast, beloved father and one of
the most genuinely good and generous people that you can imagine.
He was ingrained in the fabric of the Galaxy Project and a memember of the [Australien Biocommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/news/simon-gladman).
A sysadmin, firefighter and community builder, a traveler that understood how to bring people from different continents together.
But more than that he was a friend to many of us in the Galaxy community. Simonâ€™s clock ran out way too early - he died last Saturday,
November 26, of a heart attack while playing paintball with his children.

Our thoughts are with his family.</br>
