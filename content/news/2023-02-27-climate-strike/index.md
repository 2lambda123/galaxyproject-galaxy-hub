# Climate Crisis does not wait for your jobs to finish!
The next global climate strike will be on **March 3**! As last time, the Freiburg Galaxy Team is going to express its support more directly: the team will be striking in [Freiburg](https://freiburgforfuture.de/03-03/), if you are nearby join us!
To raise additional awareness in the scientific community, we decided to pause the job queue for a few hours on Friday. 
This means that you can still visit our website, but the server will not start new jobs. Running jobs will not be affected.

We encourage all of you to use that time to join one of the huge number of strikes that will be [taking place worldwide](https://fridaysforfuture.org/march-3/) on this day!
