[Registration](/events/gcc2012/register/) is now open for the [2012 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2012)](/events/gcc2012/).  This annual event will be held [July 25-27](/events/gcc2012/program/) in [Chicago, Illinois](/events/gcc2012/logistics/). The 2012 conference features [two full days](/events/gcc2012/program/) of presentations, breakouts, and lightning talks about extending, developing, deploying, and best practices for Galaxy.  A [day long training event](/events/gcc2012/training-day/) has also been added, covering 7 different topics in multiple tracks. 

The conference will also include talks from the [Galaxy Team](/galaxy-team/) on future project direction, and is a chance to *affect and contribute to Galaxy's future direction.*  If you are a bioinformatics tool developer, data provider, workflow developer, power bioinformatics user, sequencing or bioinformatics core staff, a data and analysis archival specialist, or are otherwise neck-deep in *data-intensive biology* then [GCC2012](/events/gcc2012/) is for you.
