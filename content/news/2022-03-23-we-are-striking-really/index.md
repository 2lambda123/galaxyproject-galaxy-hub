The next global climate strike will be on **March 25**! As last time, the Freiburg Galaxy Team is going to express its support more directly: the team will be striking in [Freiburg](https://freiburgforfuture.de/25-03/), if you are nearby join us - and maybe we will find time to talk about research as well :)

We encourage all of you to join one of the huge number of strikes that will be [taking place worldwide](https://fridaysforfuture.org/march25/) on this day!
