Within the [WP5](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/news/?tag=esg-wp5) of the EuroScienceGateway project, the Biodiversity community will be one of the demonstrators for the benefits of the EuroScienceGateway services.

This community is already familiar with the Galaxy ecosystem, and we will leverage this project to:

- identify new tools and resources to be integrated
- improve the discovery, usability and reuse of large, diverse, distributed and authoritative biodiversity datasets from Galaxy
- facilitate the compute-intensive annotation of large number of genomes to exploit data from the [European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA)](https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/)
- develop customizable workflows to facilitate the analysis of qualitative and quantitative correlations between biodiversity features or derived indices, and climate changes
