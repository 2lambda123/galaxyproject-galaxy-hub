Many people are waiting for it! We are proud to present the first Galaxy training material on [ATACseq](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/epigenetics/tutorials/atac-seq/tutorial.html) data analysis. 

ATAC-Seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) is a method to investigate the accessibility of chromatin and thus a method to determine regulatory mechanisms of gene expression.

This training material was started during the CoFest at [GCC2019](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019) and is developed by Lucille Delisle, Maria Doyle, and Florian Heyl. Thanks a lot for your contribution to Galaxy training material!
