We are very pleased to announce that the [Galaxy India community](https://www.galaxyproject.in/) has started!  Galaxy India had a [soft launch during GCC2021](https://sched.co/kLwE).  **We are planning a full community launch at [InBix 2021, during two days of pre-conference workshops](https://easychair.org/cfp/InBix2021).**

The Galaxy India community is about enabling data intensive research and instruction in India using the Galaxy platform. As a group, we sponsor:

* Training and workshops, both standalone and at larger meetings
* Webinars and community calls
* In person gatherings, once these become prudent
* [Communications channels](/community/#regional-communities), including chat and a mailing list
* An India-focused server hosted by the European Galaxy Team

If you are working in data intensive science in India then please consider getting involved with Galaxy India:
