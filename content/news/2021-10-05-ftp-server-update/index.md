On 2021-10-06, the FTP server accessible through the domain __ftp.usegalaxy.eu__, will be upgraded with a new hardware and a new configuration.
The new node will provide more space and accept only encrypted connections (TLS).

It will be easy to use as usual, just remember to select an SSL/TLS type of connection.
