Greetings! 

Happy February! This month's newsletter brings with it a few changes that we want you to be aware of:
1. As many of you already know, __Dave Clements__ has left the Galaxy project for an exciting opportunity with Anaconda.  You can find his goodbye blog post, and Anton's parting words to him in the Galactic Blog. He has done so much for the Galaxy Communty, and because he gave so much, it's going to be hard for us to do it without him, without missing him a whole awful lot. 
2. __Assunta DeSanto__ has stepped in to help fill in Dave's shoes, as best she can, while we search for a replacement.  Haven't met Assunta yet? That's okay. Check out this introductory blog post!
3. Going forward, __the Galaxy newsletter will be delivered quarterly__ rather than monthly. This means you'll hear from us less often (boo!), but that the newsletter will be filled with richer content that captures more of the big picture happenings of our Galaxy Community. 
4. We have a couple of new segments for you: _**"Meet the Community"**_ blog posts where we introduce core team members and other folk from the wider community, and a section called _**"Watch this Next!"**_ where we highlight a video from the community. 


We are excited to continue delivering the Galactic News to you, albeit less frequently and with one less star in our cluster, but with no less love for our wonderful Galaxy Community. 

Beatriz Serrano-Solano and Assunta DeSanto, Editors

[Automatic Jupyter Notebooks](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/09/24/jupyter.html)

</div>

Check out the [first GTN tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/data-science/tutorials/cli-basics/tutorial.html) to use Jupyter notebooks for coding and the command line, and that themselves run inside Galaxy.  (It's OK, you can read that sentence again.)  Using Jupyter notebooks greatly reduces the cutting and pasting in these.  See the [full announcement](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/09/24/jupyter.html) for details and link to documentation on how to use this approach.
