2022 was a year of growth for ELIXIR, the European life sciences infrastructure, which brings together scientists from currently 23 countries and over 250 research institutes.

DK: Consolidated the bio.tools registry with more than 27,000 software tools, synchronised the registry with other ELIXIR services like OpenEBench and Galaxy, resulting in the sandbox version of the [Tools Platform Ecosystem](https://github.com/bio-tools/content-sandbox)

IT: Joined the EuroScienceGateway project to strengthen the Pulsar Network and implement a national usegalaxy.it Galaxy instance

NL: Organised training on Galaxy (Smörgåsbord event) and started the microGalaxy community for microbial analysis in Galaxy

SI: Created a collaboration with ELIXIR Estonia on [new national Galaxy service](https://galaxy.elixir-hpc.si/)

ES: Released two demonstrators on how to build a federated ecosystem enabling distributed analysis via Galaxy and using GA4GH Passports and visas technologies

Tools Platform: In 2022, the new joint Galaxy-EOSC [EuroScienceGateway project]() was launched to strengthen and consolidate Galaxy as a European research infrastructure. The project works closely with the EOSC Association and involves many ELIXIR partners and members alongside key external European research partners and other infrastructures. The Galaxy user base has expanded with new software releases and the integration of the Beacon human genomic cohort search service. The project will strengthen the promotion of ELIXIR’s mature life science services in EOSC. 
In-production services:
• Bio.tools (+EDAM)
• BioConda/BioContainers
• OpenEBench
• WorkflowHub
• **Galaxy**

Compute Platform: ELIXIR AAI --> Life Science Login
An initial clientside GA4GH TES API implementation in the Galaxy workflow management system [has been delivered](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/14777) and further such integrations are planned in the recently initiated EuroScienceGateway project

The maturity journey of the ELIXIR Communities (p.39): Galaxy being in tier 3 ("Communities with over four years of work developing standards or technical solutions to meet the Community's needs.") Put image to article?

Galaxy Community: In 2022, the ELIXIR Galaxy Community achieved a milestone with the Galaxy project’s first European funded project, EuroScienceGateway. The project brings together ELIXIR Nodes to establish a distributed workflow‐based gateway to computing and storage infrastructures and services for European scientists, in collaboration with EGI and the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking. There was a continued focus on enabling data intensive analysis, both within the life sciences and beyond. The Community further expanded the analyses available for COVID-19 and repurposed them for mpox and other pathogens. The start of the BiodiversityGenomics Europe (BGE) project allowed further engagement with the Biodiversity Community. The Galaxy Training Network has been extended by the addition of new scientific areas, for  example, synthetic biology, and now covers 308 tutorials spanning 19 different scientific areas. The Galaxy Community brought members together through events such as the Smörgåsbord 2022 online training week, European Galaxy Days 2022 and BioHackathon Europe2022. Work completed at these events led to further improvement in the Galaxy platform. As part of the Implementation Study, the Community focused on facilitating data management in Galaxy, expanding workflow standard support (by increased CWL conformance and export of provenance through ROcrate) and integrating with GA4GH standards like DRS, TES and Beacon.

Marine Metagenomics: the Community also worked on technical improvements including running notebooks on the Galaxy Europe infrastructure

hCNV: The Community worked with the ELIXIR Beacon project to adapt and test Beacon v2 specifications with respect to the CNV domain [...] In coordination with the Galaxy Community and the Tools Platform, the Community prototyped a benchmarking environment for CNV detection tools. Work is planned for containerising and inclusion in Galaxy CNV callers and evaluation against whole genome sequencing (WGS) reference datasets

Australian BioCommons Collaboration Strategy: Technical touchpoints include the Tools and Training Platforms, RO-Crate, EDAM, WorkflowHub,TeSS:DReSA, FAIR training materials, Galaxy, and the Federated Human Data and Single Cell Omics Communities.

- In 2022, ELIXIR was involved in 21 EU-funded projects, seven in a coordination role. One of the highlights was the start of the European Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project that aims to realise the 1+Million Genome initiative’s ambition of creating a data infrastructure to enable secure access to genomic and corresponding clinical data across Europe.
