**We are pleased to announce that [Early Registration](/events/gcc2014/register/) and [Talk and Poster Abstract Submission](/events/gcc2014/abstracts/) are now open for the [2014 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2014)](/events/gcc2014/).**

[GCC2014](/events/gcc2014/) will be held at the [Homewood Campus](http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/campuses/homewood_campus/) of [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu), in [Baltimore, Maryland](http://visitors.baltimorecity.gov/), United States, from June 30 through July 2, 2014.  [GCC2014](/events/gcc2014/) starts with a [Training Day](/events/gcc2014/training-day/) featuring ~~four~~ *five* parallel tracks, each with three, two and half hour long workshops. There are 13 different topics spanning the full Galactic spectrum of topics.  [Take a look!](/events/gcc2014/training-day/)

**[Early registration](/events/gcc2014/register/)** is now open. Register early and *avoid paying 70% more for regular registration costs.*  Early registration is very affordable, with combined registration ([Training Day](/events/gcc2014/training-day/) + main meeting) starting at $140 for post-docs and students. Registration is capped this year at 250 participants, *and we expect to hit that limit*.  Registering early assures you a place at the conference and also a spot in the Training Day workshops you want to attend.  

You can also book affordable conference housing at the same time you register.  See the conference [Logistics page](/events/gcc2014/logistics/) for details on this and other housing options.

**[Abstract submission](/events/gcc2014/abstracts/)** for both oral presentations and posters is also open.  Abstract submission for oral presentations closes April 4, while poster submission closes April 25.  Poster authors will be notified of acceptance status within two weeks of submission, while presentation authors will be notified no later than May2.  *Please consider presenting your work. If you are dealing with big biological data, then this meeting wants to hear about your work.*

The *[GigaScience](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/)* "Galaxy: Data Intensive and Reproducible Research" series announced for the last conference has published its [first papers](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/series/Galaxy), *and is continuing to take submissions for this year's meeting and beyond*. BGI is also continuing to cover the article processing charges until the end of the year, and for more information see their [latest update](http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2014/02/06/rewarding-reproducibility-first-papers-in-our-galaxy-series-utilizing-our-gigagalaxy-platform/).
