[Register](/events/gcc2013/register/) for [GCC2013](/events/gcc2013/) by 14 June and avoid the *100%* late surcharges.  Registration is still a bargain with combined registration ([Training Day](/events/gcc2013/training-day/) + [main meeting](/events/gcc2013/program/)) starting at ~ €165 for post-docs and students (that just €55 per day). **[Register now](/events/gcc2013/register/)** to assure your spot in the [Training Day workshops](/events/gcc2013/training-day/) you want to attend.  Once a Training Day session becomes full, it will be closed to new registrations.

[GCC2013](/events/gcc2013/) is an opportunity to participate in two full days of presentations, discussions, poster sessions, keynotes, and lightning talks, all about high-throughput biology and the tools that support it. The conference also includes a [Training Day](/events/gcc2013/training-day/) with in-depth topic coverage of twelve different topics in 15 sessions across 5 tracks.

The [program](/events/gcc2013/program/) features 25 oral presentations, 2 lightning talk sessions, two poster sessions, and an ever growing number of [Birds-of-a-Feather](/events/gcc2013/bof/) gatherings.

If you are a biologist or bioinformatician performing or enabling high-throughput biological research, then this conference is for you.
