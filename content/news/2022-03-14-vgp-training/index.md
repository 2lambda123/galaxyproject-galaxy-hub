We are proud to announce that, as result of the collaboration with the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), a new training describing the VGP assembly pipeline (fig. 1) is now available in the Galaxy Training Network. The Vertebrate Genomes Project aims to generate high-quality, near-error-free, gap-free, chromosome-level, haplotype-phased, annotated reference genome assemblies for every vertebrate species.
