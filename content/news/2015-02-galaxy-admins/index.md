The first [GalaxyAdmins](/community/galaxy-admins/) [meetup of 2015](/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/2015-02-19/) will happen online [on Thursday, 19 February](http://bit.ly/1yZJSkN).  [GalaxyAdmins](/community/galaxy-admins/) is a special interest group for Galaxy community members who are responsible for Galaxy installations.

A summary of both the user and admin/developer [2014 Galaxy Community Questionnaires](/news/2014-questionnaire/) will be presented by [Dave Clements](/people/dave-clements/), a *Galaxy Project Update* will be offered by a [Galaxy Team member](/galaxy-team/), and   [Hans-Rudolf Hotz](/people/hansrudolf-hotz/) will lead a short discussion on *GalaxyAdmins direction*.

Thanks to everyone for letting us know what dates and times worked best for you.  This time and day of the week worked for a remarkable 91% of respondents.

We are looking forward to starting this group again,

[Hans-Rudolf Hotz](/people/hansrudolf-hotz/) and [Dave Clements](/people/dave-clements/)
