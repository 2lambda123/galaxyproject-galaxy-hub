AquaINFRA's goal is to provide data and processing services to freshwater and coastal sciences. Markus Konkol (52North, MÃ¼nster) and Merret Buurman (Institute for Freshwater Ecology, Berlin) will be developing the processing platform, based on Galaxy and Pygeoapi (a Python platform to run OGC-standard compliant processing services accessible via REST API). AquaINFRA will process data from diverse sources like pollutant dispersion from rivers to coastal waters in Catalunya, satellite-imagery analysis for the North Sea and the Elbe, nutrients in Baltic Sea, small river in-situ analysis in Finland, etc. They are looking for HPC resources to run dispersion modeling tasks.
