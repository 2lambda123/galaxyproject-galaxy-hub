**Wolfgang Maier** and **Polina Polunina** have organized a talk by **Alan Rubin**, working at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourn, Australia, entitled **Analyzing and Sharing Data from High-throughput Mutagenesis Experiments** at the University of Freiburg. The talk was annonced via the [Bioinformatics club page](https://bioinformatik-club.imbi.uni-freiburg.de/en/node/140).

In his presentation, Rubin discussed the challenges and opportunities in analyzing data from high-throughput mutagenesis experiments, collectively known as Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effect (MAVEs). These techniques offer insights into the functional consequences of genetic mutations.

Rubin highlighted the development of MaveDB, a community database aimed at facilitating collaboration and knowledge-sharing in functional genomics. MaveDB provides researchers with access to diverse datasets for exploration and analysis.

Overall, Rubin's talk emphasized the importance of collaboration and accessibility in advancing our understanding of functional genomics. Through initiatives like MaveDB, researchers are empowered to unlock the mysteries encoded within the genome.
