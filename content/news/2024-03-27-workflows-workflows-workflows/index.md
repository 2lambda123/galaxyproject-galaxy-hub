In the past few updates to Galaxy, many exiting changes and additions have arrived to workflows.

In this article, we'd like to shine a spotlight on three of them, which we are particularly excited about!

## ðŸ¤¯ Is that a workflow on the community hub?

It sure is! And it's also the first feature we'd like to show you: **Workflow Embeds**

<iframe title="Galaxy Workflow Embed" style="width: 100%; height: 680px; border: none;" src="https://usegalaxy.eu/published/workflow?id=6e0330de5d80e619&embed=true&buttons=true&about=false&heading=true&minimap=true&zoom_controls=true&initialX=-20&initialY=-20&zoom=0.5"></iframe>

This is the workflow editor, hosted on usegalaxy.eu, embedded inside the workflow hub.
You can drag it around, zoom in and out, view the workflow on usegalaxy.eu, or download it directly here, all fully interactive.

This does not just work on the community hub, it works on any website. Galaxy workflows are now fully embedable, like a YouTube video embed.

Powering this embed is the workflow editor in a read-only mode.

## ðŸ¤” How do I make my own embeds?

Embeds can easily be created from the workflow publishing page.
Go to the list of your workflows, and click "Share".

_notice how this list looks a bit different to before? Hold that thought_

Now make sure "Make workflow accessible" is turned on, and scroll down to the all new "Embed Workflow" section.
