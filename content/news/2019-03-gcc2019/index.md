**We are pleased to announce that [registration](/events/gcc2019/registration/) and [abstract submission](/events/gcc2019/abstracts/) for the [2019 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)](/events/gcc2019/) are now open.**

GCC2019 will be held 1-8 July in Freiburg, Germany.  The *tenth* [GCC](/gcc/) will have many familiar features from earlier years, including accepted and lightning talks, posters and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings (BoFs), training, and a CollaborationFest.  2019 also brings the [most significant conference program update](https://gcc2019.sched.com/) in several years:

* some training will be integrated with the main conference,
* three days of conference instead of two,
* several parallel sessions,
* and a strong emphasis on organizing content by domain.

GCC2019, like every GCC before it, will be built around *community*.  Training topics are nominated, selected, and presented by the community.  Presentations will  feature the full spectrum of Galaxy applications, enhancements and deployments from the community as well.

If you are working in data intensive life science research then there will not be a better place to share your work, learn from others, and find new collaborators.

**Registration**

[Early registration](/events/gcc2019/registration/) starts at €49/day for students and postdocs, and €79 / day for other academics and non-profit researchers.  Early registration ends 17 May, *when rates go up by 60%. So, [register early](/events/gcc2019/registration/).*

**Present your work!**

[Abstract submission](/events/gcc2019/abstracts/) for talks, lightning talks, demos and posters is now open.  If you work in data-intensive life science (or in other fields using Galaxy) then please consider presenting your work at GCC2019.  This is an ideal chance to present to 200+ researchers, all addressing common challenges in data intensive science.  Review of oral presentations starts on 22 April, in a little over a month.

**[Submit an abstract (or two) now](/events/gcc2019/abstracts/)!**

*We hope to see you in Freiburg!*
