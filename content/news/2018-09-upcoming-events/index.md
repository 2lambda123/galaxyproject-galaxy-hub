It occurred to me while I was typing up the [Galaxy Admin Training announcement](/events/2019-admin-training/) that there were several other big and upcoming Galaxy events before the end of this year that you may want to look at.  Here are 4 of them:

In addition to these events, there are many others offered this year, and around the world (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America) that are less than 3 days long (and are even sometimes in French).  See the [Galaxy Events Horizon](/events/) for a complete listing. 

We hope to see you somewhere!
