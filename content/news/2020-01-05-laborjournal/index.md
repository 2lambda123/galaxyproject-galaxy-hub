The **Laborjournal** is a German journal for scientists for complex methods and news written in easily understandable language. Bj√∂rn from our team was interviewed about [Galaxy in life science](http://www.laborjournal-archiv.de/epaper/LJ_19_12/50/index.html). The article is in German - you can practice your German skills ;-)
