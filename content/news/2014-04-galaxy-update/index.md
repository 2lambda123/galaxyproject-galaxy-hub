Happy April everyone!  

It's a busy time [in the Galaxy](/galaxy-updates/2014-04/) and that is reflected in the [April 2014 Galaxy Update](/galaxy-updates/2014-04/).  First, there were a [record 63 new papers](/galaxy-updates/2014-04/#new-papers) in the past month, [six of which we have highlighted](/galaxy-updates/2014-04/#new-papers) (also a record).  Three new [public Galaxy servers](/galaxy-updates/2014-04/#new-public-servers), and one [Galaxy Community Log Board entry](/galaxy-updates/2014-04/#galaxy-community-hubs) were also added in March.

However, the big news this month is [Upcoming Events](/galaxy-updates/2014-04/#events):

* **[Abstract submission for oral presentations](/galaxy-updates/2014-04/#oral-presentation-abstract-submission-closes-april-4) for the [2014 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2014)](/galaxy-updates/2014-04/#gcc2014-june-30---july-2-baltimore) closes this Friday, April 4.**
