We are pleased to announce the launch of the **[Galaxy Career Center](/careers/).**  The Galaxy community is continually searching for new developers, bioinformaticians, system administrators, and researchers. The Career Center lists openings from around the world that use, deploy, enhance and administer Galaxy.  *There are currently 13 open positions,*

Please take a look.

Thanks,<br />
