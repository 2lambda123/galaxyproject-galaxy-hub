The fifth Work Package (WP5) of the EuroScienceGateway project will demonstrate the benefits of the EuroScienceGateway services with 3 communities,
namely (i) Biodiversity and Climate Science with the impact on human health, (ii) Materials science and (iii)
Astrophysics. WP5 will showcase results from these 3 early adopters that will lead by example to embrace
Open Science best practices. Each of the adopters are at a different level of maturity in their adoption of
Galaxy for their communities with Biodiversity/Climate being the most experienced and Astrophysics the
least experienced. Together with WP1 (in particular T1.6), WP5 will support the early adopters as well as
new communities to get the most out of the framework described in this proposal and extend it if needed.
WP5 will ensure the adoption of EuroScience Gateway services.
Discussions between hardware, software, and application developers will take place to ensure the
community-driven nature of EuroScienceGateway. WP5 will endeavour to support other technical work
packages to provide feedback from the field researchers (about their usage and workflow compositions) in an
effective and relevant way.
KPIs will be derived and monitored for i) number and usage of tools and workflows developed by the
communities, ii) number of data sources accessible via Galaxy and iii) the number and usage of Pulsar nodes
(Bring Your Own Compute & Bring Your Own Storage).
