The kick-off meeting of the [DataPLANT consortium](https://nfdi4plants.de/)  took place recently. The project will run for 5 years and the European Galaxy team in Freiburg will contribute to it.

We will improve the data management aspect of Galaxy and enhance the research in plant science. We are looking forward to working with the plant community!
