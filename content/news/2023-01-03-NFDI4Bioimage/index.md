**Galaxy is part of another NFDI - the NFDI4Bioimage**

The National Research Data Infrastructure (Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur, NFDI) is an initiative jointly funded by the federal-state and the LÃ¤nder to establish an infrastructure framework for research data management in Germany. The Galaxy Team Freiburg is already part of the [NFDI DataPlant](https://www.nfdi4plants.de/).

[NFDI4BIOIMAGE](https://nfdi4bioimage.de/en/start) is a consortium of the National Research Data Infrastructure  in Germany. Its focus is on all steps of the research data life cycle for microscopy and bioimage analysis. NFDI4BIOIMAGE applied as a consortium in the third call for applications (2021) and was approved as an official part of the NFDI in November 2022. The project was [kicked-off](https://www.hhu.de/news-einzelansicht/page?tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=37167&cHash=629f9d432a9bfeb1341141829d8490d4) in January 2023.
