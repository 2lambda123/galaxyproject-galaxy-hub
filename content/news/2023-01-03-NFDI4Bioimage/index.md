**Galaxy is part of another NFDI - the NFDI4Bioimage**

The National Research Data Infrastructure (Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur, NFDI) is an initiative jointly funded by the federal-state and the LÃ¤nder to establish an infrastructure framework for research data management in Germany. The Galaxy Team Freiburg is already part of the [NFDI DataPlant](https://www.nfdi4plants.de/).

[NFDI4BIOIMAGE](https://nfdi4bioimage.de/en/start) is a consortium of the National Research Data Infrastructure  in Germany. Its focus is on all steps of the research data life cycle for microscopy and bioimage analysis. NFDI4BIOIMAGE applied as a consortium in the third call for applications (2021) and was approved as an official part of the NFDI in November 2022. The project was kicked-off in January 2023.

If you want to know more about how the data is managed in Galaxy, please visit the section [Using Galaxy and Managing your Data](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/) in the [GTN](https://training.galaxyproject.org/).

Other initiatives, like the [ELIXIR Implementation Study 2021 "Strengthen Data Management in Galaxy"](https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/strengthen-data-management-galaxy), are trying to enhance and add more features to Galaxy on the data management aspect. Galaxy is also participating in the [ELIXIR-CONVERGE project](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge/wp9), more specifically, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 Analysis (WP9) for data access, analysis, capacity building and dissemination.
