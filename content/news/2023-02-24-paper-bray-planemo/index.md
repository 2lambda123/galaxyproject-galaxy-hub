Out of the middle of Galaxy's community, Planemo was developed as a software development kit for tool and workflow developers and Galaxy power users. The authors describe how to streamline the process of integrating tools and constructing workflows in accordance with best practices using Planemo. Furthermore, the philosophy underlying Galaxy tool and workflow development gets discussed, also for those who are not professional software developers.

**Congratulations** to this nice publication and thanks for sharing your results with us!

**Abstract:**

There are thousands of well-maintained high-quality open-source software utilities for all aspects of scientific data analysis. For more than a decade, the Galaxy Project has been providing computational infrastructure and a unified user interface for these tools to make them accessible to a wide range of researchers. To streamline the process of integrating tools and constructing workflows as much as possible, we have developed Planemo, a software development kit for tool and workflow developers and Galaxy power users. Here we outline Planemo's implementation and describe its broad range of functionality for designing, testing, and executing Galaxy tools, workflows, and training material. In addition, we discuss the philosophy underlying Galaxy tool and workflow development, and how Planemo encourages the use of development best practices, such as test-driven development, by its users, including those who are not professional software developers.
