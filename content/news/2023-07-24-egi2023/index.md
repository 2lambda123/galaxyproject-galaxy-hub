During the session, the members introduced Galaxy espeically the Galaxy EU's design, setup and architecture. Highlighted the recent developments, such as object stores and distributed computing (PULSAR) a core component of ESG and the efforts to mature it to TLR-9, enabling the efficient utilization of resroucres across Europe.

The initiative aims to create an open infrastructure for data-driven research, focusing on providing a user-friendly scientific workflow and data integration platform. This endeavor seeks to achieve robustness, scalability, and integration, enabling federated computational infrastructures and democratizing research data analysis.

During the session various aspects of ESG and Galaxy were discussed including the integration of OneData platform, exploring DIRAC as a new metascheduler and ARC as a new job-runner.
