There is no better place than the [GCC2021 Conference](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition) to meet and learn from others doing data-intensive science.  *[Birds of a Feather (BoF)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/birds-of-a-feather_session)* meetups are informal gatherings where participants group together to discuss common interests.

There are [9 BoF sessions](https://gcc2021.sched.com/area/BoF) across the three conference days.  BoFs are held before and after the day's formal program. **The [current list of BoFs is available on the conference web site](https://gcc2021.sched.com/area/BoF).** 

**Want to organize a BoF?**

To launch a Birds of a Feather meetup **[submit your BoF idea here](http://bit.ly/gcc2021-bofs-call).** Once submitted, conference organizers will create the [BoF in the conference schedule](https://gcc2021.sched.com/area/BoF), and then start promoting the BoF to participants.

Each BoF will have a Slack channel on the conference Slack that anyone can join.  Each BoF will also be given a *named home table* in the Remo Social Hall building.  If you have 8 or fewer participants than you are encouraged to hold your BoF in Remo.  If you expect more than 8 participants than you will be responsible for setting up an external meeting space, such as Google Meet or Zoom, and then redirecting people to that space. The organizers will help make sure people know about any redirects.

BoFs can be about anything of interest to the Galaxy Community.  They can even have a social focus.

**Want to attend a BoF?**

It's easy. **Just show up.**

However, BoF and conference organizers will thank you if you indicate your interest [on the web page for any BoF you are interested in](https://gcc2021.sched.com/area/BoF). You'll need to already be registered for the conference to do this.
