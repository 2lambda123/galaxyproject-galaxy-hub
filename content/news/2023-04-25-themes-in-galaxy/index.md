Galaxy 23.0 comes with a new theming system, which lays out the ground work for a fully themeable Galaxy.
Themes differ from past customization options by allowing users to choose between themes.
In their current iteration, they are implemented in the masthead, but will be rolled out to allow for theming many more parts of Galaxy in the future.

This article will outline how to configure themes, how they work, some tips on developing new themes, and a hidden feature which may come in handy with highly customized Galaxy instances.

## What are Themes?

In one sentence themes can be described by: they change the way Galaxy looks.

What theme is used can be decided per user.
The setting to change your current theme can be found under user preferences.

Further, themes can help tell apart sub-domains, as each sub-domain of a Galaxy instance can have it's own theme file.
