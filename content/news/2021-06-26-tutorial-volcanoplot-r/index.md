<p>The Volcano plot tutorial introduced volcano plots and showed how they can be easily generated with the Galaxy Volcano plot tool. This new tutorial shows how you can customise a plot using the R script output from the tool and RStudio in Galaxy. A short video for the tutorial is also available on YouTube, created for the GCC2021 Training week. 
Happy plotting!</p>
