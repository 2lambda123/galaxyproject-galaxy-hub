[Participate in the *Galaxy Misconceptions* sub-committee](https://forms.gle/RCN87JEXxAR2srbv7)

</div>

Since the beginning of the Galaxy project, many negative (and very
often completely wrong) myths about the functionality and capability
of Galaxy have made their rounds in the scientific communities. The
[Global Galaxy Steering Committee](https://galaxyproject.org/community/steering/) has set up a [sub-committee](https://galaxyproject.org/community/steering/#subcommittees) to identify those myths and come up with ideas to tackle them.

[Outcomes of the workshop 'SARS-CoV-2 Data Analysis and Monitoring with Galaxy'](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2021/08/26/covid-workshop-summary/)

</div>

The Galaxy community has recently organised a workshop on SARS-CoV-2 Data Analysis and Monitoring with Galaxy. The goal was to build capacity, both in the analysis and data management sides of SARS-CoV-2, based on the acquired expertise since the beginning of the pandemic. On a broader scope, sharing the experience in SARS-CoV-2 data analysis, and fostering the principles of open data, open science and open infrastructure are key aspects in the current public health global situation.

Researchers in all career stages (PhD students, senior researchers…) and different roles (clinicians, laboratory manager, technicians…) have joined the workshop. In total, the registration surpassed the __750 participants from 82 countries__!
