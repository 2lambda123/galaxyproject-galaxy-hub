We will upgrade to 19.09 tomorrow morning at 9am local time (2019-10-03 09:00:00 CEST). We expect the process to take ~1 hour.

- We do not expect a downtime of the website, but some links may not function properly until the upgrade is complete.
- There may be some delays of job scheduling as we restart processes when they are updated.
