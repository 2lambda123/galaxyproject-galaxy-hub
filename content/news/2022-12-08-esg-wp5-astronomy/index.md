Astronomy community will be one of the domain use cases of EuroScienceGateway project [WP5](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/news/?tag=esg-wp5).

Rich and diverse open science practices in Astronomy have not been so far substantially coordinated and harmonized with similar activities in other domains, especially BioInformatics.
 
[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and [UP](https://apc.u-paris.fr/APC_CS/) partners will engage in EuroScienceGateway project to integrate catalogs of astronomical workflows and data, in particular those included in the [MMODA](https://www.astro.unige.ch/mmoda/) platform.
