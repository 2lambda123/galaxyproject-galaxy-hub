Galaxy is again participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) as part of the the [Open Genome Informatics Consortium](http://gmod.org/wiki/GSoC).  

And we need your help, of course.

# How to help

## Galaxy Community, before March 29

*Give some thought to what would make a good GSoC project and then propose them.*  Good ideas are both tractable and impactful.  Also, consider if you have the time and expertise to server as a mentor.  If you don't then can you identify who does?  GSoc has [extensive documentation describing best practices for both mentors and students](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/).  When you are ready, add your idea to the list of possible projects [by adding it here](http://gmod.org/wiki/GSOC_Project_Ideas_2021) or by sending your idea to [Dave Clements](/people/dave-clements/).

## Students, March 29 through April 12

Want to work with Galaxy?  We hope you do, because we want to work with you.  To be considered for GSoC we recommend:

* Review the [GSoC Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) from Google.
* Review the [possible project ideas](http://gmod.org/wiki/GSOC_Project_Ideas_2021).
* If any of the projects interest you then reach out to the listed mentors to find out more.
* Submit an application to Google no later than April 12.

We hope to work with you this summer!
