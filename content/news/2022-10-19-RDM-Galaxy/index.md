Galaxy is well known for its computational capabilities: tools, workflows and infrastructure to run analyses. However, to be able to reproduce and reuse those analyses, a proper data management stategy is needed. And the good news is that Galaxy does it without you noticing! 

There are typically seven stages involved in the data life cycle: Plan, Collect, Process, Analyse, Preserve, Share and Reuse. Galaxy is involved in almost all those stages managing your (meta)data.

Other initiatives, like the [ELIXIR Implementation Study 2021 "Strengthen Data Management in Galaxy"](https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/strengthen-data-management-galaxy), are trying to enhance and add more features to Galaxy on the data management aspect.
